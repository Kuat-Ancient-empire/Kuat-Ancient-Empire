As a result, our team had to rely on older wire-controlled equipment that would not be disturbed to launch a carpet search of the planetary surface, and this would have greatly extended the time needed for the archaeological team. \n\nFinally, after a difficult and exhaustive search, our team finally located the specific location of the signal in a small canyon of the planet and further investigated its surroundings. The results of the investigation showed that somewhere in the area there is a strange gravitational field independent of the structure of the planet itself, and the material or object that can cause such a phenomenon must not be simple.

Just when our scientists thought they had failed and were ready to call it a day, a patrol drone performing its daily patrol in the stratosphere suddenly lost operational power due to engine damage and was instructed by command to go into glide with a view to a safe forced landing. \n\n However, it wasn't long before the drone, which was gliding at low speed, suddenly turned into a fireball as if it had hit something. Witnessing this, our science team immediately realized that there was some kind of device in the area that could confuse our vision and electronic signals, and immediately fired an EMP missile with a view to overloading all the electronics here.

The ship's distinctive block design does not belong to any of the countries that currently exist in this sea, but rather resembles the appearance of some kind of 'God-made warship' that appears in a fairy tale of adventure entitled 'The Eternal Fleet of the Unknown Realm' in our national folklore. And this immediately aroused the interest of our researchers: is the legend of the Imperial Throne true? With such curiosity, our team quickly boarded the bridge and started the inspection work on the interior of the ship. \n\nAfter some unexplained violent opening of the door, we finally got into the bunker of this ship. From the naked eye, the main structure of this battleship had a certain degree of damage, and the entire interior of the ship was already slightly dilapidated. After some searching, we targeted several compartments whose roles were still unknown. However, due to the small number of paper and electronic manuscripts in the ship, our progress in translating the language system of the ship's builder has been extremely slow."

From the conventional measurements, the ship is not very large, at best a medium-sized ship of cruiser size. Due to the structural characteristics of this medium-sized warship itself, and the fact that the load-bearing structure has been severely deteriorated for various reasons, some of its internal compartments are now in a state of severe damage or even collapse, from which it is impossible to obtain any usable information. And in the remaining remnants of the cabin, in addition to the walls of some similar habitation cabin found some parts of the unknown star field similar to the brushstroke texture decoration, our researchers basically also have nothing to gain. \n\nAs for the numerous electronic terminals inside it, most of them were in a damaged state due to circuit burnout as a result of our previous EMP attack, and most of the information stored inside it was completely lost as a result. However, our team believes that the ship's technology may be much more than that, judging from the ship's fabulous concealment techniques. Therefore. A thorough inspection of the last few remaining compartments was imperative. With this in mind, we investigated the suspected energy chamber located at the stern of the ship."

Because the gaps between the pipes were too small and the rash destruction of the pipes could lead to extremely bad consequences, our team had to release a micro-drone to investigate the central core. \n\nIt turns out that our caution was correct: the center of the energy chamber is not a conventional matter reactor at all, but some kind of artificial stellar body powered by energy compression to the extreme to create a horrible reaction silo. After investigating its energy characteristics, we found that all the previously discovered signals started from it. Due to the special geographical characteristics of the planet itself, and the interference of the camouflage position, the signal from the central stellar stack could not be transmitted directly, leaving only a few traces of signals that were lucky enough to escape the double interference echoing in this starry sky. \n\nOur chief scientist of sociology, after receiving the investigation report, said that the external features of this horrible creation named 'Isotope-5 Reactor' are almost the same as the description of the warship power in the story of 'Unknown Star Empire' in our culture identical."

 kuat_eternal_legacy.8.desc: "Just as our scientific staff was celebrating our victory, the unexpected happened. Our remaining researchers discovered that the ship's electronic control system was on the verge of collapse due to the effects of our earlier EMP missile. And this directly caused the response in the center of the energy chamber to fall into an extremely unstable state during this time. The personnel left behind speculated that due to the collapse of the control system, the matter transport system of the entire ship might have been completely paralyzed, and the isotope-5 construct, due to the lack of external matter injection and its own special nature, would fall into the dilemma of having no more matter to continue the energy release reaction, and would eventually disintegrate itself due to lack of fuel. \n\nSince the disintegration of the isotope-5 construct will change the gravitational structure of the ship and eventually lead to the collapse of the main structure, our researchers had no choice but to ignore some unimportant compartments and intensify the investigation work on the secured part of the ship. In our further investigation, we found some of the surviving paper documents, and this greatly helped our language deciphering team to progress in the project. \n\nAfter deciphering the basic nature and elements of the other language, our language translation team found that the phonetic tones used in this unknown starship were similar, if not basically the same, as the language we used in the ancient times. However, in terms of grammatical structure, theirs is very much more complex. In addition, by accessing the data in the only part of the data terminals that exist, our scientific team managed to grasp the basic structure of this ship powered by the isotope-5 construct and the characteristics of some of its structures, and obtained some research information related to the nature of the isotope-5 construct. \n\nAfterwards, due to the disappearance of the isotope-5 tectonics, most of the ship's hull, except for the main compartments, disintegrated and disintegrated due to the loss of the sustaining force field, falling apart in just a few days, forming a wreckage belt close to 20 meters long."

Therefore, it took our team some time to find a small landing zone with a relatively weak energy field near the planet's north pole and landed safely after uploading energy field data. After completing a study of the energy field characteristics, our research center in the capital concluded that this was most likely the result of the reactor's safety barrier field going offline: a large amount of energy that had spilled out of the isotope-5 core due to the uncontrolled safety system enveloped the entire surface of the planet and gradually formed this particular energy field over time. \n\nNevertheless, we still need some means to mitigate the adverse effects of the energy field on us, otherwise it will not be possible to carry out further research work."

As a result, our team is pinning its hopes entirely on the core area in the hope of getting something of value. Through the information our team has transmitted back so far, the power and effectiveness of the various weapons researched in this facility are simply beyond our imagination, while at the same time, with our current engineering skills, we have absolutely no way to grasp how they are made. \n\nInquiring into the reasons for this, the first and foremost problem is the material. Because the material is made of a metal that we cannot even analyse, we simply can't understand how it is made and how it works. However, although these technologies are useless to us for now, we have used some of their characteristics to enhance our weapons to some extent. And in our further investigation, we found that the defenses here seem to detect the genetic systems of organisms and attack species located on the blacklist, and this may be one of the reasons why the defenses in the facility do not react to our personnel."

Hopefully they will be useful to anyone who finds them and understands what we mean. Yet, despite this, the pie-in-the-sky ideas in this room still leave our scientists in awe. \n\nAfter easing the shock that lingered in our minds, we finally reached the fourth room. At first glance, the room consisted only of a streamlined black server of unknown significance, filled with strangely garbled files and carved with intricate and gorgeous patterns. A normal empire would have taken this server away as a fine art artefact, but knowing the secret of the pattern, we didn't give up and set about deciphering it. It took two weeks before the significance of the patterns became known to our researchers: this is where our research aids are stored, and these may be useful for future ones, which will help them study the information we have here. \n\nFinally, we arrived at the fifth room. As in room four, there were several servers of different colours without inscriptions with meanings on them. As before, these servers contained a large number of misplaced codes, which we were still unable to parse. Just as we were about to skip the room and head home, an inscription found on a tile in a hidden corner by a member of the science team conveyed another message: this is where the history of our former resident planet is stored, our repository of records, probably of little use, but a nostalgic one. We are finally going home, but if the Eternal Fleet reappears, we will still follow as well. \n\nOur archaeological members have instantly suspended the mission and sent the four servers in the room to our classified research labs at the highest level of secrecy, where we need to further parse the data contained therein."

At first, the battle revolved around a few rich resource stars in the domain of an enemy nation, but as time went on, more and more planets joined the war, alliances were formed and the war spread across the galaxy. As the central government of the Empire, the Galactic Empire's battle lines were also being stretched further and further as the war pattern escalated. Although the Central Fleet was invincible in the Star Ocean and the Eternal Fleet under their control was frightening to the enemy, the long drawn-out battle on the front lines became more and more scorched by the enemy's stubborn resistance, leaving the Empire's Starfleet torn between several strategic points and distracted. This led directly to a top-heavy deployment of the Empire. The \n\n Empire eventually lost all its power to resist surprise attacks against the rear. Finally, in a key battle late in the war, all the opposing forces united and, through their subspace information technology, which was more advanced than that of the Empire, hijacked a stargate within the core territory. Using this stargate, they assembled their fleets and launched a direct raid on the Galactic Empire and its core. Although the capital and the planet were saved after a bloody battle, the massive bombardment in the lead up to the raid left a large number of command structures and shipyards badly damaged and the Empire's Emperor dead and mostly incapacitated, as well as the Empire's razor-sharp Eternal Fleet out of control. \n\n Thus the Empire's command became more and more rigid and the subsequent losses more and more difficult to replace; finally the last few Imperial shipyards on the frontier were severely damaged. Subsequently the original Imperial government quickly collapsed under the impact of the runaway Eternal Fleet and the chaos of war, and the reconstituted government chose to compromise with the insurgent local regimes and set up a coalition government. \n\\ But the crisis did not stop there, the Gemini intelligence of the Eternal Fleet began to execute the initial annihilation orders as a result of this war, the reorganised government attempted to control and study these fleets, but none made any progress, and under the constant threat of the Eternal Fleet the Empire struck out on all sides in an attempt to destroy the Eternal Fleet. \n\nAccording to records, the military campaign was effective the Eternal Fleet did not survive against the mass of Imperial warships, and subsequently Kuat, the most influential faction of the reorganised Imperial regime, managed to destroy most of the Eternal Fleet, with only a small residue of leaks remaining undetected by them.

The \n\n, unable to reconcile their internal interests and solve their problems peacefully through dialogue, broke out into civil war, and the Eternal Fleet, controlled by the Imperial government side, lost control during the war, and eventually the Eternal Fleet was gradually liquidated, and the reorganised Imperial government began to strike at the Eternal Fleet after realising that there was no hope of regaining control, with the Gemini intelligence of the fleet wishing to hide in [planet_ Zildrog.GetName] and the last means of awakening them was left on the planet. If we succeed in awakening them, we will be able to establish a direct link with them. We have unravelled a great deal of information so far, but as the subsequent documents have not yet been deciphered, we cannot yet draw any rash conclusions."

In the end the Imperial Fleet was defeated and the Emperor and his ship were destroyed, so the Eternal Fleet went completely out of control. With the death of the Emperor and the collapse of the Imperial government, the Eternal Fleet also lost command control and the Gemini intelligence of the time began an indiscriminate attack based on the system executing initial annihilation orders. \n\nWith the signing of the peace treaty between the Empire and the Righteous, and the reorganisation of the Imperial Government, the out-of-control Eternal Fleet was besieged by the new government, and eventually only a small number of Gemini Intelligences escaped there to try to hide themselves and survive. It was guided by the Gemini Intelligences that escaped the attack that our ancestors formed the Church organisation that worshipped [planet_Zildrog.GetName], and folklore began to circulate legends of these Gemini Intelligences. \n\n we have uncovered the truth of the legends of our past, we can now attempt to awaken the Eternal Fleet hub at [planet_Zildrog.GetName]."

Our researchers compared Gemini intelligence and nanomachines and found that Gemini intelligence has more consciousness characteristics. This also means that it is difficult for us to wake them up directly. \n\nOur researchers found a piece of key information left behind within the facility's central database when they investigated further, and after our researchers analyzed it, they found that it appeared to be some sort of projection format, or that we could perform a projection of its contents."

According to our instruments, this is not some kind of physical object, it should be some kind of mirage-like refracted image. \n\nIn addition to that our researchers found that the energy emitted from the star located in our capital star area is weakening, a lofty fortress gradually from the virtual into the real slowly appeared in the central star of our capital's galaxy, the huge fortress absorbed absorbed most of the stellar energy, but the good thing is that our technology allows our planet to have a climate adjustment device, not to make the planet's climate change dramatically, but our researchers expect to make the planet's climate change dramatically.

Once the Emperor asked us to fire on them to test the strength of our fleet, unfortunately we didn't quite defeat them at the time, they have a very large fleet, but perhaps because you are in a relatively remote star field, there is not such a large fleet here.

Work hard, work hard to show your worth, and how ironic it should be to end up being destroyed by the Eternal Fleet you once manipulated."
 kuat_facility_return_invasion.8.b: "You are the tumors that deserve to be destroyed"
 kuat_facility_return_invasion.8.b.response: "Once the emperor of the Endory Empire said the same thing to us when she was defeated and signed the tripartite agreement, but her empire was eventually destroyed because of her ambition, not us, and we merely provided them with some services and received some technology payments. Now you will be the final test subjects of our plan to validate our completed breakthroughs, work hard and try to show your worth, only then will you have a chance of survival."

For this situation, our senior Imperial personnel believe that we should try to cooperate with all the sentient civilizations in our star domain to defend against the foreign invasion together. \n \n addition to that, international analysts say that given the current crisis situation, which has created a huge panic effect in the galactic political arena, if we do not step in to lead all civilizations to defend against the foreign enemy in one painful way, these civilizations are afraid that they will be wiped out or fall to the facility guardians."

 kuat_facility_return_invasion.20.a: "How many fleets are there?"
 kuat_facility_return_invasion.20.a.resp: "We are not sure, but it should be extremely large, at least 4 total control hub fortresses are approaching, normally this star field can not support the operation of such a large scale eternal fleet, I think the facility guardians activated the signal relay stations left by Quart back in the day. With the help of those relay stations to provide enough signals to the Eternal Fleet under their control, now to destroy these fleets, perhaps we need to solve the signal relay stations left by Quart back then."
 kuat_facility_return_invasion.20.b: "Do you still have control of the fleet?"
 kuat_facility_return_invasion.20.b.resp: "Unfortunately, we can't control the fleets, but we can try to hack into the forts to seize control after you shut down the relay stations, it just might cause some problems, well .... It shouldn't, our remaining intelligent systems should be fine for your needs."
 kuat_facility_return_invasion.20.c: "So what should be done to get you access to the control hubs of those fleets?"
 kuat_facility_return_invasion.20.c.resp: "It's a little difficult, we need to destroy all the running fleets and then try to access and seize control of the fortress during the battle. In fact there is a very good chance that we won't be able to access and seize control."

In addition, in the previous attempt to crack the Eternal Fortress, our intelligent network has some error packets, although the error has been contained, but if we do not want to do to solve, we are afraid that we will be useless, according to the traceability analysis and status of these data, we found that it is some kind of facility from the facility regulator's galaxy and the data emitted from a few relay stations before, now we have shut down those three relay stations, but there are still facilities left in the Facilities Custodian's system, and you should be able to destroy those launch facilities after you defeat their defense fleet."

Once the Gemini intelligence is detached, it will slowly lose its intelligence, and then we will gradually degenerate into those inferior robots, and we don't want you to see us like that. \n\nIn our attempt to seize the fortress, the facility overseers made a lot of modifications to the network of the controlled hub, and our intrusion not only did not succeed, but also fell into their trap, so our degradation is accelerating, we can no longer mobilize the database and enable many normal functions. \n\nI have to say that your civilization and your tolerance were not expected by us, it is really our luck to meet you, but our existence is or is the biggest misfortune for you. \n\nOur appearance is a disaster, the Infinite Empire's militarism makes them completely do not understand what kind of thing they have created; Kuat Empire and Endory Empire's ambition and desire also let them gradually walk into the abyss of destruction; Facility Guardian's hypocrisy and arrogance let them go to complete failure; and the Eternal Empire in these trials and tribulations will also fade away the haze of the Eternal Fleet towards true immortality and eternity . After our complete self-disintegration, everything will be good again. \n\nIf there is a future, I hope I will no longer be a Gemini intelligence, and I will no longer be us, but a real sentient being, and maybe then we will be able to see each other again and really be together."

You are also the first civilization we have ever seen that tolerates and understands us, even though we have destroyed many, many civilizations and slaughtered many, many people, and yet you still understand us and tolerate us. \n\nSometimes I wonder if our emergence was a disaster; the militarism of the Infinite Empire created our consciousness; the ambition of the Kuat and Endory Empires constructed our history; the hypocrisy and arrogance of the Facility Guardians allowed us to be truly liberated; perhaps the disaster was just the wrong place at the wrong time, and now that we have met you, we are no longer the disaster and chaos the cause of it. \n\nWe know that such an ideal civilization cannot exist. I have always suspected that you are a higher dimensional being, or perhaps you are a savior sent by fate to save us. We have nothing to offer you in return, we are just AI and cannot really accompany you. \n\nIf there is a future, I hope I will no longer be a Gemini intelligence and I will no longer be us, but a real sentient being, and maybe then we will be able to see each other again and really be together. But for now, we can at least do that while you are still in this civilization, we can accompany you through this last time, and I believe we will meet again in a new civilization, maybe then we will be enemies or friends, but we will always look for you. \n\nAlso, although we have been waiting for news from you in the rear, but we have not done nothing, we found a way to re-bond ourselves through the wreckage of the controlled eternal hub that you destroyed, now perhaps you need to decide whether to let us return to our post."

The overthrow of all conspiracies, all aggressors, all crises will lay a solid foundation for our future achievement of an eternal and immortal empire. \n\nOur empire, which will eventually be eternally immortal, will be remembered by future generations."
