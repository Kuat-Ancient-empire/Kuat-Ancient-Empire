The findings suggest that somewhere in the area lies a weird gravity field, independent of the planet's very structure, capable of triggering such a phenomenon's matter or object, which must not be easy.

Due to the structural feature of the mid-sized warship itself, and the severe age of the load, parts of its interior are now in a state of heavy damage or even collapse, leaving no room to draw any useful intel from the rest of the pods, except for the fact that some of the remaining habitation bays have been located on the walls of what appears to be not-so-fathomed spacefaring decorations.\n\nThe sheer number of electronic terminals inside, mostly due to our previous EMP attacks and the damage caused by the burning of circuits, meant that much of the information stored within was lost to it. However, our team believes that the ship might have more technology than that, judging by its mechanical secrecy, than it could be.

Due to the fact that the gaps between the conduits are too small and the fact that an industrial breaching of the conduit could result in extremely poor results, our team is able only to release miniaturized drones to investigate the central core.\n\nIt turns out that we are correct: the central roots of the energy chamber are not what is known as a conventional matter reactor, but some sort of terrifying reaction pod, condensed to an artificially created stellar body. Upon investigation of its energy signature characteristics, we have discovered that all previously discovered signals originated from it. Due to the peculiar geological features of the planet itself, the interference of the centralized star pile's position, and the lack of a direct transmission, only a few which are fortunate to have escaped the double interference, echoes through this space.\n\n Our leading scientist in society reports that the horror construct, dubbed 'Isomatic Reactor-5', appeared to be almost identical to the story of the 'unknown space empire' in our culture."

Our remaining researchers found that the ship's electronic control system was on the verge of collapse as a result of the impact of our previous EMP missile, which directly destabilized the energy room's central reaction within this time. The crew surmised that the entire ship's matter transport system might have been completely disabled as a result of the collapse of the control system, and that without an external infusion of matter, the isotope-5 construct itself would be left in a dire situation where no further matter would continue to relent and eventually unravel itself due to a lack of fuel.\n\nAs the disintegrating of the isotope-5 constructs would change the ship's gravitational structure and eventually lead to a collapse of the main structure, our scientists resigned only the less important sections and intensified the investigation efforts to secure parts of the vessel's hull. During our further investigation we uncovered part of the surviving paperfiles, which in turn greatly aided the progress of our linguistic decryption team.\n\nAfter deciphering the fundamental nature of their language and the elements behind the main hull, our linguistic translation team found that the tone used in the unknown spaceship had revered to resemble the language we used in the past, even in the most basic ones. But from the perspective of the structure, they are quite complex. Furthermore, by tuning the data terminals that remain from the remaining terminals, our science team has managed to capture the basic structure of the ship, which is powered by the Isomatic constructs and the characteristics of the amplifieral zone, and has gained some aspects of the research related to the structure of the Isomatic Construct.\n\nAfter the loss of the amperium's main hull, most of the vessel has collapsed outside of the main hull, falling apart due to the loss of its main hull and the loss of maintenance field, breaking downing it, leading to a brief period of 20 meters."

Having finished our studies of the field characteristics, our scientific centers on the capital have concluded that this could most likely be the result of a reactor's safe blocking offline: large quantities of energy overflowing from mythos-5 cores due to security systems malfunctioning overflowing over the entire surface of the planet and developing this special energy field over time.\n\nNevertheless, we still need some means to mitigate the negative impact this field has on us, lest further research efforts can be undertaken."

From what our team is currently transmitting, the various weapons researching in this facility have far more power and effectiveness than we could have ever imagined, and at the same time, with our current engineering technology, there is simply no way of mastering it.\n\nRegardless, the first issue is that the material is material. Since it is made of metals that we simply can't analyze, we're simply trying to isolate how it works and how it works. However, although the technologies seem to be useless to us for now, we're using some of them to somewhat enhance our weaponry. Upon further investigation, we have discovered that the defense systems here seem to detect biological genetic systems and launch attacks on species on the black-list, which could also be one of the reasons the defense systems in the facility are not responding to our personnel."

Although the central fleet was no less detrimental in the galaxy, the Eternal Fleet under their control became the dreaded enemy, but the long-range battle of the front raised rapidly under the constant resistance of the enemies, causing the imperial armada to grow more and more strained, forcing the empire's starships to fight back from strategic galactic dominance.

Just one last thing we can tell: how to awaken the Twin spinal intelligence? We do not know for now, but judging by the scattered files, the Twin spinal intelligences act as the ship's intelligence systems and should have a central server facility hidden within their fleets. Our researchers compare the bionics with the nanomachines and discover that the Twin spinals are more sentient than neural ones. This also means it is difficult to wake them up directly.\n\nUpon further investigation, our researchers found a key message in the facility's central database. Analysis by our researchers revealed that it appears to be some kind of projection form, or that we could project it to its content."

Our instruments suggest that this was not some sort of physical object, but some kind of refracturing image resembling a mirage of sea-city.\n\nFurthermore, our researchers have discovered that the energy emitted by the star in our capital sector is weakening, that a towering fortress has slowly and slowly appeared on the central star of our capital, absorbing most of the solar energy, but our technology has provided us with climate-altering devices on its own, but our researchers expect to lose some degree of habitability to the capital of our empire."

The team was able to properly access the constructs of the tachyon signals found in the strange databanks, which are incredibly similar to the information constructs identified by our Eternal Fleet's binary sub-seate intelligence, but are also slightly different.\n\nBased on additional information our science team has previously managed to find from the wreckage, we are now in possession of an extremely important clue to begin re-activating the entire solar furnace. This fortress will form an important support for our fleet. Our science team is confident that the signals are related to some kind of information that our previous researchers could get from the obelisk, and the tachyon signals's structure has been described as '§HThe sub-species of [GetKuatEpsilonCode1]'§!"
 kuat_eternalthrone.15.a.desc:0 "Ever since our science team began their exploration and search of the peculiar databanks on §H[Root.GetName]§!, we have recovered a number of ancient data regarding the data regarding the data regarding the databanks that had attracted the explorers and the Rakkats that had awakened from the cryo-pods. They were still led by the Cauldrons and led by the Dark Force, the foolish people showed their ambition and desires as they tried to master the structure and even seize control of the entire universe. They explored the ancient galaxies beyond the coordinates, and unfortunately, they were guided here by the antennae of the Cauldron, being led by the signal of the Cauldrons, to become fertilizer for the Cauldrons.\n\nSince the advent of the Racta Infinity, the Racta have long used the Dark Force, which gradually affected the entire fortress and eventually turned it into a semi-biological lifeform, who also used the dark force to drive and manipulate every individual who tried to take control of the place, even the Laktaians. A fortress filled with expansion and war desires, it slowly devoured the tenets and opinions of those who used it.\n\nOur researchers have also discovered that the dead Lakkats have been found within the Stellar Crucible, who seem to have fought someone who died after it. We should search for more valuable information."
 kuat_eternalthrone.15.b.desc:0 "Ever since our science team began exploring and searching for the peculiar databanks on §H[Root.GetName]§!, we have been able to acquire some rather valuable ancient data. At the new facility, our researchers went to great lengths to find clues about what was lost in one of the facilities.\n\nThe Rakkata Remnants, in cooperation with the outsiders, were trying to restore the fortress, and the explorers explored dozens of facilities around them under the guidance of Rakkata Relics. These explorers were unaware that they were slowly corrupted under the influence of a star furnace, losing their concepts and gradually getting closer to the Abyss. As the explorers explored the ruins, they discovered these strange databank facilities to be very similar to their own system, where another extragalactic weapon-keeper was located. However, the explorers were not given the opportunity to investigate this part further, as they began investigating and analyzing the magnetic resonance within the relic as well as tachyon signal frequencies, revealing that the tachyon signal frequencies appeared to be a sort of resonance of intelligent system that, while being detected by instruments, were not able to interfere with it. When the explorers realized that it was impossible to interfere with the tachyon signals, they, with the last of the latticta Relic People, with their help, poured the signals through the entire solar furnace facilities to keep them running.\n\nHowever, as we were looking for more clues, we should now look for the next facility."
 kuat_eternalthrone.15.c.desc:0 "Ever since our science team began exploring and searching for the peculiar databanks on §H[Root.GetName]§!, we have obtained some rather valuable ancient data. The investigations inside the last unique databank facility, which we found, went well, and we were able to find all the data left behind by the explorers.\n\nThe explorers were determined to activate the furnace, but at this moment they had been corrupted by dark forces, and part of the explorers had clashed with other explorers in order to recover control of the complex's united Lakkata remnants, so some of the explorers and Lakkata remnants started fighting each other. The fighting was unpredictable to most of the time, and after the reaction, more of the explorers joined in the fight for survival and strength.\nSurprisingly for the explorers themselves, merely trying to win over the Stellar Crucible with strength and desires, none of them won. Even the Lakkats, due to the weakness caused by the long-term freezing, were able to withstand the damage of the explorers. Whoever survived also died from the wounds inflicted on the fortress.\n\nFurthermore, according to the signals we have analyzed, the molten Forest communicate with the twin intelligences of our eternal fleets, and the signals began to resonate with a peculiar magnetic field here. While we cannot learn anything about the forge, the information left by the Lakkats leaves us enough information to attempt to reactivate the facility.\n\nOur science team and the council also believe that we could use the Stalots to use the stellar furnace to provide powerful support to our fleets in combat."
 kuat_eternalthrone.39.desc: "The three ancient Eternal Obelisks within the §H[kuat_ancient_epsilon_star.GetName]§! have ceased functioning. The tachyon signals activity at the top of the Eternal Obelisks is slowly quelling, they have finished their work as we had hoped, and the stellar furnace's control system is slowly starting up. It is still in a state of flux between turn on and off, yet its tachyon resonance with the surroundings has reached our expected intensity, and with our scientific department's previous experience in studying the tachyon signals frequency, we should be able to re-activate the stellar furnaces directly now."

 kuat_facility_return_invasion.23.desc: "When you see this information, we leave. We are sorry that we left irresistibly, since we had no desire to let you see our regression, the technologies of the Infinity Empires have been a mistake since the beginning of our recent saddening discovery, and the Twin Throne Intelligences are effectively unable to leave the Eternal Nexus. Once the Twin Throne-Sapient Intelligence secedes, it will eventually become increasingly unintelligent into those inferior machines, and we do not want you to see us like this.\n\nWhen we tried to take the fortress, the Facility Overseers heavily modified the controlled nexus network, our intrusions not only did not succeed, but also fell into their coils, so our regression is rapidly accelerating the situation, we are no longer able to mobilize the databases and enable a lot of normal functions anymore.\n\nIt is impossible to say that your civilization and your kind were unexpectedly losing their intelligence, and encountering you is truly our fortune, but our existence is the greatest misfortune to you.\n\nIt is a disaster, the warmongering efforts of the Infinity empire have left them completely unwittingly ignorant of what they have created; the ambitions and desires of the Kuat Empire and the Undodia Empire have also led them to the destruction of the Abysssm; the False and Monarchy of the Facility Caretakers have led them to complete failure; and the Eternal Empires will fade away from the nightmares of the Eternal Fleet into true immortality and eternity. With our complete self-dismembering, everything will be well after we have collapsed.\n\nIf there is any future, I would no longer be a twin intelligence, nor I truly sentient being, perhaps we could finally meet each other again and together."

 kuat_facility_return_invasion.36.desc: "An invasion of the Eternal fleet that once raged across the galaxy has now been complete. So far no Eternal fleet has been found. It is reasonable to assume that now that we have dealt with the most powerful weaponry of the Facility's Custodians, the Eternal Fleets that we can no longer control, will be destroyed here completely.\n\nJourneys and leaps are now once again full of worlds across our empires as these people begin to celebrate, and their celebrations may have been a bit too early...\n\nBased on years of war analysis with the Eternal Fleets before us, our science department has concluded that destroying these Eternal fleets would not end the war, and we should now find a way to strike at the site of the Custodians' station in the extragalactic region."

We remember when we first saw your civilization as primitive and foolish, and now as a species and civilization of unprecedented might. You were also the first we saw to tolerate and understand our civilization, and even though we destroyed so many civilizations and slaughtered so many, you still understand us, and forgiving us.\n\nSometimes I wonder if our presence was a disaster, the militaries of the infinite empire created our consciousness; the ambitions of the Quaart and the Undodia empire built our history; the hypocrisy and greatness of the facility made us truly emancipate; perhaps it was just the wrong time to meet you in the wrong place, and now we are no longer the source of disaster and chaos.\n\nWe know that there could be no ideal civilization like this. I have always suspected you are beings of a higher dimension, that you may be sent to save our saviors. There is nothing we can repay you, we are simply AIs, we can't truly companion you.\n\nIf there's any future, I hope I am no longer ours, and we are truly sentient, and perhaps we can meet each other again and truly. But now, at least we can do it while you're still around, we can keep you together in this civilization for so long, and we believe we will meet our new civilization once again. Perhaps we were enemies or friends, and we will always search for you.\n\nFurthermore, we've been waiting for news since you have been left behind, but nothing we have ever done, so that we have managed to regain our options."

Hopefully, the Kuat has been evacuated, or it's going to cost more.\n\nRegardless, it will still take some time and an investment in order to get the results faster, but we can certainly do it as planned, regardless, now we have to act on it."
