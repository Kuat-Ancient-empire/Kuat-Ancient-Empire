Now you will have access to the answers to this war.\n\nEternal Fleets, like us, do not belong here, and we have always been there, and we still do. And that is what we have based on. Where the Eternal Fleet belonged to, we weren't entirely aware. Our once-Eternal Emperor returned a colossal fully automated battle system that he called the Eternal Fleet, which he called the Eternal Fleet that obeyed to our Emperor, unless his emperor died. But reality is so intriguing that Eternal Fleets were completely controlled by our thrones, and during our civil war, the Eternal Emperor and the throne were utterly lost to the power of the warships reactor and chaos began as a result. It has taken quite a bit of time to complete the reorganization after the fall of the imperial government.\n\nAlthough the Eternal Fleet has thus lost control, to us the Eternal Fleet will not be enough to get the attention of the new Imperial government, as we now have complete mastery over the technologies of the Eternal Fleet, their very existence is no longer of value. These fleets of the Eternal Empires are a disaster to us, and even to you, the ancient intelligence systems of the Ioccas must be brought to an end as well, and you are the key to putting an end of this show."

After the destruction of the ancients, we managed to build outposts and supply depots to protect the primitives. It was a fair deal to purchase our supplies, for we provided them with security and prosperity, and they provided us with support. But the power and desires of last repeat, blinded their eyes, and the Endory Empire provoked a brazen invasion of our glorious conquests, though they sought their own survival, our benevolent council gave them an opportunity, and the Endory's Flame ultimately survived.\n\nPerhaps as the favor may have been foolish, the favored by the old ambitions of the past, the new zone revolters have been growing tired of the process, so we prepared for a grand show so that you have managed to complete this final show. You will become an age-old civilization, and the legacy of the galaxy will be restored."

But it is clear that after a millennia of war you primitives have been left toiling away at all, and with the recovery and development of your technology, we will not only have to face the asinine challenges of the eternal fleets. With the fleets being utterly destroyed elsewhere, our progress has displeased the Imperial government, as you would say, by having chosen agents to help us set up the Relaystations. The initial stages were smooth and the three relay stations were set up within this section of the galaxy. But the foolish Endory stands in their way. They allowed the Eternal fleet to stand down and shame on the Imperial Council. Endless, Endory is still responsible for their actions, but we have failed to eliminate them, and End the fires.\n\nThough blocked by the fools, this will not stop us from continuing the project. As planned, we will set up three relay stations, and will begin to begin the project as you challenge our rule. So the eternal fleets of this area will now concentrate completely on this section, and you will engage the Eternal fleet in the most direct conflict with them. We will use the tachyon features of the tachyon field created by the relay stations when the dust settles, to allow our stations to completely lock the sector, and then end everything that the fleets of the stars and fleets exist.\n\nNow, with your efforts, the fire is about to bloom, and enjoy themselves for a while."
