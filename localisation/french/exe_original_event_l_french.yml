However, the signal was deemed to be too weak or even malfunctioning to be of some sort, and our science team has been struggling to isolate its contents. It is to be hoped that our colonists on §H[Root.GetName]§! will be able to siphon off resources to support our science team's unique databanks and survey, adding some tachyon amplifiers to the remains to help our science team in its research on this strange tachyon signal.\n\nUnfortunately, it may not be easy to modify the peculiar databanks on §H[Root.GetName]§! to work on them. The ancient tachyon signal transmitters at the center of the site would cause serious disruption to our efforts, and our science team will need additional resources to find a solution."

These databanks are heavily related to the ones drawn to the expedition, who have been led and lured by the dark force, who have shown their ambitions and desires in an attempt to master the whole structure and even attempt to dominate the universe.\nThey are probing for ancient galaxies that aren't above the coordinates. Unfortunately, they are guided here by the twinkling signal fired by the forges, and have become a fertilizer for the forges themselves. Ever since the collapse of the Qata Empire, the automated maintenance system of the entire solar furnace has become independent, making the whole fortress almost a lifeform as the black force had been used by the Qata Infinity empire for a long time, and it has driven and manipulated every single individual trying to tame the place with the dark force. A fortress full of expansion desires and war desires, it has stomped on the user's principles and ideas.\n\nWhile our scientists continue to investigate, parts of the facility are almost destroyed, and we are unable to gain some valuable information from it."

While exploring the ruins, explorers discovered the odd databank facilities similar to their own facility in the system where another, intergalactic weapon custodians were located. The explorers were unable to investigate this further, but as they began investigating it from what they knew to be part of the wreckage and analyzing the magnetosphere resonance within the wreckage as well as tachyon frequencies, it appears that the tachyon signal frequencies are resonant frequencies of some kind of intelligent system, though they can be detected with instruments, with extreme stability being impossible to interfere with. As the explorers discovered that tachyon signals could not be interfered with, they decided to pour them into the whole solar furnace by feeding them into the cornerside facility for them to function.\n\nHowever, as we were looking for more information, we should now look for the next facility."

The battle was unpredictable to all at the time, and after the reaction, more of the explorers joined the combat prowesss and powers.\n Unnervingly, the explorers were nothing more than to fend off each other and fight over the furnace, yet none of them emerged victorious and the last who survived perished inside the fortress. Furthermore, according to the signals we analyzed, the array of communication signals of the war machine Eternal, which amassed with the unusual magnetic field. Although we cannot know the specific information about the furnace, its history is filled with fear and war, and our researchers believe its creators to be mostly wiped out completely.\n\nOur science team and council believe that we could use the Stellar Crucible to provide a powerful boost to our fleets and use similar tachyon signals, which we can attempt to activate the entire relay station and broadcast out of space, which would allow us to utterly destroy all our enemies!"
