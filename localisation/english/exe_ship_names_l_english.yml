 kuat_mission_6_chain_desc:0 "The Kuat Dynamics flagship limit system will serve as a global system to control the maximum value of the current Kuat flagship under construction.

Under normal circumstances, please be sure to have one and only one flagship on each fleet, and one and only one flagship for each fleet§! . Flagships are all star dreadnoughts built in limited numbers. The operation of this mechanism will provide you with an invincible time ranging from 3 to 8 days when facing non-eternal fleet units when your fleet with a flagship engages (the enemy also has this mechanism if it has a flagship). The invincible time is determined by the type of flagship; in When facing the Eternal Fleet fleet, the flagship mechanism will give your fleet the ability to resist the damage suppression of the Eternal Fleet, allowing your fleet to produce 1%-75% output, and at the same time, the flagship can be killed before non-flagships are killed. Always maintain protection (but cannot resist event kills and instant high damage). §!\n\n§PMechanism 2: Dynamic correction mechanism section. You can adjust this mechanism through the opening settings to decide whether to enable it. The dynamic correction mechanism is the core mechanism that affects combat units in all camps of this mod. This mechanism is divided into Two parts and a supplementary mechanism: \nThe first part is the self-protection part. This part will allow the Eternal Fleet series, Kuat series, Overseer Council series, and Infinite Empire series camps in this mod to resist any high-level halo suppression. The effect, that is, the effect that is not affected by the aura correction;\nThe second part is the mechanism guarantee part, which acts on players and is used by the Eternal Fleet series, Infinite Empire series, Kuat series, and Guardian series, among which the Eternal Fleet series part It is the most important part of this mod. The function of this mechanism will maintain the complete operation of the flagship system and the combat capability of the Eternal Fleet. \nThe last is the supplementary mechanism. The supplementary mechanism is the supply zone mechanism. The supply zone is used to increase the flagship effect and weaken the dynamic correction function. This mechanism is mainly generated for the Eternal Fortress and the Sky Fortress (that is, to encourage local defense operations). §!\n\n§BMechanism 3: Event effect section. This section is mainly used by the Infinite Empire series, Kuat series, and Guardian series. The special event mechanism operates as a random event in the battle. Different camps have different effects. The Infinite Empire has the ability to copy ships and commanders. The Kuart series has the ability to randomly reduce the cyclic damage of enemy ships in a short period of time. The Guardian has the same principle as the Kuart. §!\n\n§HMechanism 4: Guarantee mechanism section, this part mainly affects the Eternal Fleet and Infinite Empire. The guarantee mechanism is mainly used to maintain the stability of the judgment of the end of the event and to perform abnormal restarts. For example, the Eternal Fleet cannot be killed by more than 90% of the ships instantly in one day, and the mechanism of canceling the resurrection function of the enemy if the number of enemy resurrections exceeds 5 times in 4 days. etc. The guarantee mechanism plays an important role in maintaining the stable operation of mod events. §!\n\n§RTo put it simply: there must be one and only one flagship in the fleet. The flagship can only serve the fleet in which it is located and cannot serve across fleets. The flagship type is any star dreadnought built in limited numbers. §!(The above will be executed on difficult difficulty and when dynamic correction is enabled, otherwise no reference is needed)"
