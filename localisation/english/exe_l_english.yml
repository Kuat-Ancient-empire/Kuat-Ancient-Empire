Our researchers argue that the planet's ecosystem is too ecological to be inhabited by any large species, and that it does not appear to be engineered to originate from it. The magnetic field and gravity of the planet is a resonant pattern different from that of other planets, and the resonance of this pattern has created a unique tachyon signal that our instruments have picked up upon unusual places. [leader.GetName] decided to lead her science team on a full survey of the planet. The discovery by our researchers that this planet was not once a habitable and good eco-system suggests that this planet should secure it's ecosystem in a peculiar way, perhaps related to the resonance caused by the tachyon signal's shifting gravity.

[leader.GetName], based on the geological and spatial distribution around them, believes the complex to be artificially constructed. Given the size of the structure, which should not support a large population, it is likely that a camp was set up by an ancient exile. After analyzing the surrounding environment and the circumstances surrounding it, our researchers concluded that it should have been built for a very long time and that the stability of the complex was no longer stable.\n\nAfter [leader.GetName] and her team managed to stabilize the complex, our researchers are certain that the signal originated from the tower building located in the center of the ancient complex, which can, in fact, see the glowing crystal light from the tower's spire, which our researchers believed to be the source of the signal.\nHowever, after [leader.GetName] approached, the gravity of the surrounding planet seems to have shifted, and it appears that the ruin's builders were experimenting with simulations and planet gravity. It seems that our team could not directly access the crystal, which should allow our researchers to gain access to the crystal.\n\nAs far as we can tell, [leader.GetName] has been able to discover some ancient experiment data on the source of the crystal, which may give us access to the crystal."

Atmospheric atmospheric composition of the gas giant and the storm were not as distributed as a storm of a normal gas planet. The storm of the planet had been orbiting around the main colossal aerostat, the entire structure still standing still under the storm. It was a site we were looking for. \n[leader.GetName] decided to take her team to the floating aerostat building center of the storm. After a general survey of the floating amoeba, [leader.GetName] found a large number of mostly preserved and intact facilities within the aerostat structure, specifically built to evade what the enemy had created, and the whole aerostat structure interfered and shielded the atmosphere by manipulating and searching it through the storm. Strangely, our science team found no signs of life remaining in the entire fortress, the entire a completely dead city. \n\nHowever, after landing on the floating city by her team led by [leader.GetName], they found a reasonably intact landing platform on the floating city's surface, which is currently inaccessible from the ground, the ground, but our crew successfully made their way to the platform of landing on the upper levels. After landing on the surface of the planet, on the surface of [leader.GetName] found some peculiar words on the platform, which our scientists seem to have been able to extract from the civilization's once-dwell-recording technology by studying the meaning of the words: cloud's interior.

According to a recent report from our [leader.GetName], this tower was linked to the cataclysmic storm that ravaged the entire planet, which we may have found next to it. \n\nAfter further investigation, [leader.GetName] has verified our guesses that the central tower is not only the center of the cloud city, but also appears to be connected to the unusual storm on the planet. The central tower is the center of the vault itself, and while it's no longer operational, the ancient facilities within it continue to wreak havoc on the planet. [leader.GetName] decided to continue the investigation, after reaching into the central tower's facilities, found an ancient computing device at the top of the central tower that is still functional, which is incredibly similar to the computing equipment we currently use. [leader.GetName], in the Quest for a trial, decided to try and acquire information on the device, but in a shocking display, the computing equipment appeared as though [leader.GetName] did, and by taking control of the room, it was a strange video image of [leader.GetName]: \n\n§YWe are the builders of the facility.

Our comrades remain undetected, our mistake and the fall of the mystery remains. We cannot understand what this is going to happen, but we cannot hope this is not going to see it.\nOur empire was once incredibly powerful and entrusted with the rapid growth and development of military industries. Our military technology made us among the most powerful nations of the galaxy, but we were not satisfied. Our ambitions led us down on a path that brought about great discomfort, and we accepted the so-called support of outsiders. The imperial government looked to the idea of razing it with great force, but they had never thought we were nothing more than manipulated puppets. Having signed an agreement which introduced us into the Abyss, the empire had bought and introduced a large amount of their advanced ship production lines and technologies. But it was not for long...

The $misc_system_desc_2$ were much more preserved than the previous facility.

Taking into account the civilization's encounters and the remaining AI message, our researchers found in our report that these technologies should have some part to play with the truth of the war and that the empire that once destroyed the ancient civilization may still be watching us from the void.\n\n Eventually, our researchers analyzed the technology they had been able to acquire and discovered by using a special warship that the Ancients tried to resist their enemies, our researchers were able to discover that this warship was capable of interfering with the enemy's weapons and of directly attacking their own fleets.

But the remaining images and the battle site at the $misc_system_desc_3$ facility show that the Undodia Empire was no longer able to resist at this time, in fact, they were not even able to protect its people.

By estimates, the brimming of ships here is beyond the limit of military power we now know, and the gargantuan structures that are now only left of ship debris and damage.\n\nMeanwhile, our researchers have discovered that some of the wreckage, in addition to the armadas of both the Undodia Empire and the ships they were faced with, have discovered a whole new shipwreck. This wreckage, which we have never seen before, even in any other sectors, has been found in the same unique wreckage that we have found in the region of space, which may mean the involvement of a third party in the ongoing war, in which our researchers have found out that there are simply similarities between the ships of the Endory Empire's ships and the ships that sell and service of the Quatrut Empire.

Such a strong energy reaction seems to be the result of some type of planetary bombardment, as currently unknown to us, but this is not something we have seen or have studied before. However, as we have no information on the Fallen Empires, it might be related to them. As a result, it is unlikely that this could have been the level of destruction caused by a battle. The entire ring segment is in an unstable balance, and the ring segment could break down at any moment. \n\nHowever, when studying these peculiar energy reactions, [leader.GetName] discovered that the rapid signal received by the instruments was very similar to the one the energy signal had been changed through a regular pattern of 7200. In the most intense places of the signal, this was a peculiar top building, damaged by the damage, but according to the signal, the top of the tower's shape seems to be the location of the signal."

 kuat_legacy.54.desc: "After discovering the building where the signal originated from, [leader.GetName] took her team to the ancient spire with [leader.GetHisHer] gate and cracked open. The device's reaction grew stronger and stronger as our science team dug deeper, and according to the structure of the ancient spire, it was either an administrative or research center of an ancient civilization or some kind of important structure. The structure inside the entire spire was so complex that it appeared to be the deployment of some sort of defence system, that the remnants of its defence system seemed to be completely inert as the remains had been damaged. Even a significant amount of the defence facility was seemingly destroyed by some kind of weapon, not like the trace left by the age of the spire. \n\n[leader.GetName] and her team, inside of the complex ancient spire, were able to locate a sealed door inside, which was still intact. The dust on the gate had become completely gargantuan, and the gate was barely capable of cracking open. As soon as [leader.GetName] was out of control, the gate slowly opened under control of whatever power it contained. The inside the facility's central control AI remained operational, and the gate allowed our scientists to enter the facility. As soon as [leader.GetName]'s central control chamber walked into the control room, the central mechanical complex and server complex began to glimmer on it. \n\nA sound echoing throughout the structure: §Y[leader.GetName]'s databank, which according to the analysis of the data module, had been active for around 100 millennia, and the system had been functional for around 100 years, and the databank needed to be transferred. \nAt the main sensor system failed, the backup protocol was activated and the data distributor began to pick up. §! \n\n[leader.GetName] responded to our findings, and our scientists were surprised to find out the location where the artifact's main AI had been exposed to our databank. According to our databank, the ancient space station was dedicated to studying the alien technology it had been built. Despite being wiped out by the ancient civilization. Only a lot of information we could extract..The facility's AI systems shut down after relaying this part of the transmission, sleeping in the ruin, along with its creators."

The signal indicated is not at peak, and based on the radiation-energy readings around it, analysis of the signal flow as compared to the flow of energy emitted by the source after 7200 cycles was still not the same, and after that it should hide some secrets. [leader.GetName] decided to proceed with her team, her keen sensations and the data analysis revealed that there should be something else up there.\n\nAs the team struggled to find, there is a huge energy reaction beneath the laboratory's server swarm, which worked quite well with the stream of data. [leader.GetName] and her team discovered a small rocky rocky lower on the back wall of the server swarm, that right as she clicked down it, the server cluster appears to have been raises by some gravitational force generator, leading out the entrance to the tunnel below.\nOur science team, carefully walking under the passage, discovered this was a narrow passage, which they found to be surprising when they stepped out of the corridors, outside a unique temple structure which appears to be behind the tower.

The signal was sent not long enough, which is why the receiver showed very faint values. After going deeper into the temple, our science team found that the inside of the temple was extremely different in appearance, and that the outside crumbling was likely just to deny some of the important secrets behind it. As our science team dug deeper into the center of the temple, it turned out that they entered an ancient databank, where the stone's walls and the vast array of test instruments and testing devices appeared to be still in perfect order. [leader.GetName] tried to open a central server, unwittingly when she was ready to break the codes, but it turned on to [leader.GetName]. It should have automatically opened access to the server. It appears that the previous AI management system was open to data.\n\n Our science team tried to get a few blueprints and a virtual video image after analyzing the data information received before the datalog was input into the server's data base.\n\nAs soon as the video was open, a vague image of the girl was found before [leader.GetName]: §Yfriends, you can stand on the station here to confirm that you have received the blueprints.

From afar, they were also able to see the towers of uncollapsed cities and possibly abandoned buildings. Scans of the area showed that the city shows an ancient and rousing city pattern, and even now seems to have been reduced to ruins, the low ruins in the central high-rises still standing out as remarkable.\n\nThe energy reaction inside the shielded ring segment was a good bit higher than the previous one, and after scanning the area and studying the distribution of the ruined cities and the radiating energy reactions, our science team found that the signal in the square of the center of the city was strikingly obvious and [leader.GetName] took her science team's decision to go there."

The city radiated in and around the center's main arteries, and the mere visible surface path reflected the city's supposed to be a thriving city, but now the city is in ruins, unnerving. After reaching the central square, our science team found out that the source of the signal was underground, but the city was completely ruined. The interior of the tower was utterly unexplorable for investigation and study, but the already dried-up lakebeds in the central square might have drilled through the surface. \n\n[leader.GetName] turned to us for a large amount of engineering machinery, which collapsed under the powerful excavation ability of the engineering machinery, during which the riverbeds dug underground, but was mostly unharmed by the engineering machinery and the scientific staff. The collapsed location exposed the underground railroad network of the city, which should have been used by the ancient civilization. According to the instruments's feedback, perhaps the source of the signal would have been in the underground ones."

It seems the underground passage was not so long gone. A contrast of the surface scans of [from.planet.GetName] showed that the area where the passage was located is not on the map.\nWith the exploration team going deeper, the underground passage only led to a sealed underground site. Because of the long depth of the buried underground, the facility was almost new to the level of destruction on the surface. Our science team, after sifting through and analyzing the site according to the energy reactions, discovered a strange orb-like facility at what seems to be the control center. Just as [leader.GetName] approached the facility, the energy reaction of the device produced some resonance, the spherical device was activated, and the large screen of the facility was suddenly activated. The viewer of the city was shown on the screen.\n\n §YAll imperial citizens, please note, quickly travel to sector A-11, quickly evacuate the engine, please board sector A-11, repeat, and quickly retreat to sector A-11, again.\nSolders: our fleets have been unable to fight, but our people will be unable to evacuate the facility without holding off their giants.\n\nSer: We cannot help our team and send word to the §HD facility§! and we will return them all...to the empire's glorious...§!.\n\nThe footage was broadcasted, and our team analyzed what appears to be the ancient civilization's ruins.

Unfortunately, the ancient civilization's shield was easily breached, so there was the one we just saw.\n\nUnfortunately, the improved shield technology of the ancient civilization did not survive the facility, but we were able to locate the Quatutum Planetary Shield technology inside the facility.

A large array of strange and damaged ringworlds center around the dyson sphere's frame. These rings seem to have been completely destroyed, and no single ring has been detected to be functional.\n\nOur scientists argue that the system's megastructure is highly irrational, and the dyson sphere would not be built on a black hole's hull, and the ring's habitat should not be built in such a place.

For now, however, we have no information on how to follow up this information.\n\nOur scientists' findings on these wrecks and the central damage megastructure are similar to the megastructure's technology we have learned so far, and perhaps we can try to restore this megastructure if we possess the knowledge of the Dyson Sphere's construction technology and ringworld."

However, unlike what was expected to be a vast void of space or an artificial basement, there is nothing at all, even if we continue cutting the source of the signal the only thing we have recovered is an crude signal transmitter. As our scientists dismayed at the fact that everything was nothing more than a farce by one of the boring, alien beings, one of our intern researchers working alongside the scientific expedition has brought forth a bold idea: Is there a connection to the rest of the planet? Could this be the same signal point that one of the unknown beings had set up for the outsiders? Embrace, our science teams have made a thorough search of similar signalwaves across the planet. The result is: we have detected the same signal at a similar depth in two other places, and the three source are linked to each other, right in an equilateral triangle.\n\nSpecies from where the three signal sources are being transmitted, perhaps something in the middle of this triangle? In a try-and-be case, our science team has shifted to the right uppermost part of this triangle and began digging into another round. It will take some time for the results to come."

The door was made of a space alloy by some sort of craft, with no inscriptions or artifacts beyond its central location. According to our analysis of the door's cutters, the door may have been in existence for thousands of years, perhaps even more. Though it is a pity that the engineering team installed cutting devices on the door, sawing up an entrance to the massive scientific equipment that can be accessed. Our drones' preliminary scans indicate that the room behind the door is massive, filled with various enigmatic electronics. Most of the electronics are both shut down or destroyed, save for a giant monumental column at the center of the facility and emergency green light that runs throughout the facility.\n\nFurther expeditions are no doubt needed. The various branch halls within the artificial structure have been found, as well as numerous electronic instruments that have been shut or otherwise small down. Moreover, the central pillars are likely centered around the entire underground facility. To learn the mystery, we will have to invest considerable effort and resources into ensuring the success of the research effort."

 executor_build.33.desc: "After a cursory scan of the underground facility to prevent the establishment of a defensive force, our science staff entered and proceeded with a series of archaeological missions, with a series of achievements. Based on the results of the deciphering of the surviving paperfiles and the surviving computer terminals of the language used by the builders of the underground facility, we were able to understand the meaning of the word in the door: the §R8th Sanctuary§!.\n\nWith the deciphering of the language, the work was complete. According to the content of the data core found in the hold of a supposed regional administration center, the builders of the facility were an ancient civilisation. With the fact that they were caught in a massive war and the battlefield is now at stake, the civilization tried to revive in the future by constructing ten permanent sanctuaries.\n\nBeing one of the ten vaults built later, this facility was tasked with the various duties of a large resource cache, a refuge for refugees, and a terraformed terraforming facility in the future. According to the administrative texts on the core, however, according to the structure, the vault should have been moved forward according to order and according to some mysterious reason, after which all the relevant data had to be artificially wiped out and most of the subsequent data could not possibly ever be restored. Along with the valuable data related to the race and the nation's name of this race, along with all the information they know about their history.\n\nIf we want to know what happened to this empire, it is inevitable that the central hub will be deciphered."

While we have profited so much from this, if we are to truly unveil the mystery of the eighth vault, we must find out what was preserved within our central computer located at the center of the facility. If the process of decomposing and decomposing the other computers in the facility was fraught with uncertainty, the process of deciphering and decomposing the central computer proved difficult indeed, so much so that our researchers at one point suspect that the cylinder, in its gargantuan form, had been completely locked to death. At last, after countless days and nights of suffering, our deciphering efforts have resulted in a critical breakthrough and some of the nexus's data storage was finally open to us.\n\nHowever, once fully expected to begin accessing the parts already unlocked in the database, only massive chunks of extremely badly damaged datafiles remained. Among them, humanoid documents were mostly ruined, and the technologically-like documents remained only partially or slightly superior to our existing technological level. Our data analysts surmise that this civilization, in order to prevent their last legacy from being completely exposed to some sort of threat, it might be possible to design a data mastery program so as to prevent one of our empires from getting their knowledge once they were done.\n\nWithout all the hopes that we will be able to retrieve all the remaining data and control over the facility, we will have to proceed with it. However, judging by the data officer's decision, it is unlikely that this will ever be easy."

As our experience has accumulated, our team began to scale faster, confident that the entire processing process would improve accordingly. At last, with the last data module fully deciphered, we were given full access to the facility. Just as we had anticipated, the massive technological documents from the databanks intended to revive the empire were ruined by the central computers during the decryption process, and the remaining parts were simply beyond our current technologies. All human and administrative files from the empire, aside from individual files that were either erased or otherwise slipped out of existence, all of them were simply wiped out, leaving no trace behind.\n\nUnsurprisingly enough for our researchers to begin examining the wrecked fortunate people, it turned out that all but some very simple files gave an overview of the empire's history, most of which were references to the operation of this vault's various facilities.\n\n But there are finally some revelations to return, according to what we found in the analysis of the "§R<error!" vault, there is a special vault called the "Black Path". The coordinates of this facility were also recorded, but fortunately, we were able to locate the hyperlanes leading to these coordinates. The initial scans have been updated on the galactic map.\n\nFurthermore, as we now possess complete knowledge of the facility's resources we have completely stored on it.

From the surface, the planet is flat and covered by thick ice and snow. However, our signal searchrs have clearly searched the signal frequencies below the planet which were consistent with previous ones. This proves that this is the place we were looking for."

Unlike the last vault however, the vault is highly secure, and apart from the automated defense systems we've encountered on the way forward, the vault's doors are secure and locked in complex programming. Based on an extensive analysis of the material and strength of the gateway's material, our team now that our science will absolutely not be able to blow the vault open without heavy damage.

From the scans, there was not as much a shelter as some kind of data storage facility: a massive number of servers were placed in the main storage room of the facility as they wanted, and a lot of data terminals in varying levels of destruction littered all over the room where they were supposed to store supplies. As with the previous vault, the central location of the facility was a central computer in an active cylinder. From the cursory scans the facility was a complete mess, some places were littered with parts and documents, revealing just how terrified the last defenders were when they were evacuated.\n\n Our team has entered the facility and is attempting to restore some secondary ports."

However, just like all previous data terminals, all data regarding the empire's humanoid history was cleared away, leaving behind only a partial message regarding the great war that would have dragged the entire galaxy into the sea of fire at that time. According to the recovered data, the data storage hub, which was called the 'high-distance', was originally constructed in the last batch. As a refuge, the empire had invested untold amounts of personnel and material into it, and had successfully used advanced nanites at that time, transforming the place into an interstellar paradise. However, after further degradation of the empire's aggression, according to one directive of the empire's headmasters, the base of resources and garrisons were evacuated in great numbers, instead a large number of data storage terminals and servers were suddenly transported here in volleys. After conducting a 'covertary process' over the terminals, the last crews were evacuated from the facility, sealed off the doors and detonated a weather weapon and converted the place back into a frozen hell.\n\nAll information regarding the situation was then explored, as the eighth vault only contains an overview of the area. Our scientist team is attempting to restore the servers in the main hall, and we hope there's some information left behind in the shuttles."

Regardless of how our data engineers managed to repair them, there were endless row after row of scrambled code.

Perhaps this computer holds the answers we need. However, given the inherent complexity of the hub's coding, we will have to invest more resources and time into it, as well as be prepared for the worst. Our foremost physicists theorize that it may take months, or even years, before our team can fully unlock this facility, unless our computer technologies make a more significant breakthrough.\n\nAlso, it is worth mentioning that after the translation and cleanup of the files we cannot process now, some of the servers and computers that were leftover in the main halls could take away our considerable amounts of stress due to their overcomputing capabilities.

The title had a wide range of approaches, ranging from complex function problems to physics problems to fantastical logic problems, and some even referred to advanced questions we were studying or not yet researched, which were closely related to the research or knowledge-hacking stages. Our foremost physicists claimed the facilities would not open if we did not answer questions and unlock them through hard decryption. Now that there is no other way, we can only produce a temporary medal that sets all the topics up as game contents to call in people across the empire without giving them secrets.\n\nIt is said that [leader.GetName], after some pause after certain solving, complained to the team members as to "come back to a student age of pain and joy"."

The central computer somehow did not stop our replication.\n\nAfter full access, a single box in our database was able to find out all about the Gateway and how to unlock it. This so called 'gateway', was the mysterious ring gate we discovered in interstellar exploration. The document mentions that this portal was constructed by an extremely powerful alien civilization in the ancient times, and was locked by extremely complex special codes. However, in one of the wars, the mighty empire at the height of learning about how to lock it from a captured data facility found it, and preserved the records. In that war, the fighting situation became more and more difficult as the powers of the empire rapidly shifted. In order to give future generations access to the secrets of this moth, the empire's eternal secrets would have to be preserved in this last and most secret vault, and all knowledge useful to those who would come after it had been stored.\n\n The final entry reads: 'The last word in the archive reads: 'The stone of the stranger who found here is that we hope you will be able to learn the lessons so that you do not stray.'

Because of the hazardous facilities in our galaxy, of course, we cannot grant you access to our systems, and any access to the sector has been closed. Communications are a good option. Anything you wish to know?"

It was also equipped with a planetary shield generator to defend against orbital bombardment. They ultimately failed.

As for the databanks of the ancient empires in the sector, we have discovered that an ancient tachyon signal that appears to be similar to the one in the ring section of the ancient Science Facility is located here on the corner of what appears to be a nexus of seemingly automatic research facilities. Despite their weakness and secrecy, the scientific staff has found clues about the databank keys that we need to find in areas that do not seem to be unlike regular rings. It would be worth investigating the databanks in order to benefit our next research projects and research progress.\n\nIt is worth noting that this ring section was once a centre for the scientific development of an ancient civilization. Our earlier research into the databanks might be an important opportunity to further our understanding of the ancient civilization.

Initial research and geological prospecting suggests this appears to be a science supply facility for an ancient civilization, but what should be worth our notice is that at this point there is a high risk of hidden important information regarding our subsequent work on ancient databanks.\n\n[leader.GetName] does not believe we should end this, and [leader.GetSheHe] has already made a full scan and survey of the belt through our advanced instruments. We should now wait for new information."

At this point, it is highly likely that some important information about our subsequent efforts to open the ancient databanks was hidden on the ring, which will give us a boost to our own progress.\n\n[leader.GetName] has been successfully excavated for the first time.

It is unlikely that our researchers have deduced that this ring was destroyed just like any other ring that once bombarded this part of the galaxy, but as a whole the structure has been well preserved throughout the ring. Perhaps because of what the unknown civilization of the bombardment discovered here, they have slowed the bombardment, or else there is something unbeknown to be preventing it from being carried out, which should help us find some clues to the ancient databanks."
 kuat_legacy.182.b.desc:0 "After a long period of extensive scans, the ring facility has been completely exposed to us. Just like the remains of the previous civilization, this facility was not simply an automated research facility - or a military testing center - of an ancient civilization. We deduced that we could still be able to gather some information about what remains of the facility, but as the ancient civilization clearly sustained some major damage, the facility was damaged by some kind of massive bombardment just like the one we landed on, but whether it was the cause of the shield or something else, the bombers seem to have deliberately slowed the bombardment. Alternatively, we should be able to find out in some areas of the ring where the remains of an abandoned colony with burned traces of it were found, which our researchers assume to have been destroyed just like the ones that once bombarded the sector, but something came up, which preserved only a small amount of information from the facility - in general, according to the survey of the entire planetary ring itself, there are a number of technologies and artifacts not unlike the one that remained, which may have led to the discovery of the ancient databanks."

From what our scientists have determined to be a method of bombing the surrounding ringworld, it appears that the facilities were not broken as inhabitable as they were discovered - the city buildings are relatively well-preserved, and a large number of high-rise buildings are still standing after the war. The remains of the relatively urban site, which our researchers have found to be completely devoid of life in the entire surface environment of the complex, through scans of the surrounding heat signatures, determine that the area was completely devoid of life, much like our neutron-purge bombing methods, and that the only source of the bombardment was the unfortunate and outright destruction of the entire complex, which is now completely a dead city.\n\nIt is worth noting that our tachyon sensors, judging by the small, broken tachyon signal emanating from the towers in the center of the city, believe that this should be the seat of the databank key we are looking for."
 kuat_legacy.183.b.desc:0 "As a result of previous lessons our researchers have learned from exploring the ruins, they have been able to give us the relatively accurate conclusion - that our ring is a method of bombardment that was supposed to be destroyed by a less destructive method, evidently the method used by the bombers in order to preserve some documents or information. The city facilities are not broken as inhabitable to previous discoveries, and are much more intact than an otherwise reasonably well-preserved facility on the surface of the ring, despite the fact they have lost their life. Judging by the comparison with the previous remains, the facility appears to have been violently purged of most life on the surface by some kind of neutron-purification process, so the city has been entirely reduced to a dead city.\n\n But our researchers were able to analyze the asteroid's long-ranged tachyon sensors via scans, giving us a weak, interrupted tachyon signal from the tower in the center of the city - a location our researchers believe that it is the key to the databanks we are looking for."

The grotto's grotto seems to be a pattern identical to that of the empire's ancient civilization. Our scientists used the textures retrieved from the artifacts, using it to create short-filled items by printing devices. After [leader.GetName] filled the faked patterns on the spire's south side, the door to the south side of the spire was completely opened, and our researchers now have access to the spire to search for our goals."

Based on the schematics obtained from the artifacts, our scientists manufactured short-lived items using the structure materials obtained from the artifacts.

The distortions do not merely react to the field, but also within the spire's space, a unique phenomenon that hampers or makes it difficult for our researchers' progress in their survey.\n\nFurthermore, our researchers often find out that the relative location of space has shifted when they are not moving, which our researchers believe might be one of the important clues to find some sort of databank within the facility."
