      kuat_lagacy.100.name:"Strange Signal"
      kuat_lagacy.100.desc:"Our deep space radar station has captured a series of abnormal celestial activity signals from the endless depths of space. Experts in the relevant fields have already begun studying these signals, and we believe a relevant research report will be released soon."
      kuat_legacy.100.a:"Very good, we are waiting."
      kuat_lagacy.101.name:"Report"
      kuat_lagacy.101.4.desc:"Honorable leader, I will now present the findings of this study to you."
      kuat_lagacy.101.0.desc:"The special celestial activity detected by our radar station has some peculiar characteristics. Based on the intensity of energy output, it seems to be a chain reaction triggered by a supernova event. After analyzing these abnormal celestial activities, we found that they are arranged in a certain array. Through our analyzer's analysis of this array, we obtained a series of cosmic coordinate information."
      kuat_legacy.101.a:"What do the signals represent?"
      kuat_lagacy.101.1.desc:"Yes, these are several cosmic coordinates. After our team members located these coordinates, they found that the coordinates are close to our capital, yet we had never discovered a hidden star region there. It's as if it suddenly appeared. Perhaps our detectors malfunctioned and failed to detect this star region. We have confirmed the coordinates of one of the relatively stable star systems."
      kuat_legacy.101.b:"Coordinates?"
      kuat_lagacy.101.2.desc:"Yes, it's very strange. It does indeed look like a star system that suddenly appeared. We are currently using detectors to remotely collect data on this star system. The data returned shows that this star system seems to have been moved to its current position by some external force and has been hidden right under our noses for tens of thousands of years. However, these data still cannot unravel the mystery of this star system. We found that this star system is very similar to the $Name_A_1$ star system we previously discovered, perhaps there is some connection between them."
      kuat_legacy.101.c:"Suddenly appeared?"
      kuat_lagacy.101.3.desc:"We unanimously believe that remote scanning and detection cannot unravel the mysteries of this star system. We need to dispatch researchers and research vessels to investigate the secrets hidden within the star system."
      kuat_legacy.101.d:"So what should be done next?"

 kuat_legacy.104.a: "We want to learn the secrets of the Crystal Beacon." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.a.res: "Oh, Crystal Beacon, it seems that many people are very concerned about the Emperor's legacy. \n\nA long time ago, there was a civilization. With the efforts of generations, they established a prosperous interstellar civilization, a republic that belonged to them. But the life of the republic was not long. A political change that affected future generations broke out in its capital. This political change caused the republic to be reorganized into an empire. They began to expand outward and quickly occupied most of the areas in the star field, and then contacted the foreign forces that had long been entrenched in the star field. \n\nAfter seeing the power of the foreign forces, they became their proxy forces in the star field, and continuously exchanged natural resources and manpower exports with foreign forces for military and technical support, until the emperor came into contact with another foreign force, and the empire began to secretly infiltrate the earliest foreign forces, and finally a war broke out, which completely collapsed the empire. \n\nBut fortunately, the intervention of another foreign force quelled the military conflict and left some civilizations for the empire, although these survivors had forgotten their past. Those who did not forget the past became part of us. \n\nLooking forward to your next visit." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.b: "We want to know the secret of $Name_kuat$." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.b.res: "$Name_kuat$, they don't belong here. Their fate will return to the original, but they don't realize their situation. \n\n$Name_kuat$ began with the warlord oligarch government that rose after the collapse and split of the Galactic Empire. Based on their own shipbuilding industry, they played an important role in the reorganized warlord government's action to clean up the Eternal Fleet, but due to their lack of the characteristics of the Force, they did not have an advantage over the $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ forces of the Imperial Warlord Union. \n\nIn order to compete for influence and control in the parliament and the Imperial Warlord Government, they carried out research operations in the name of cleaning up the Eternal Fleet, trying to master the technology of the Eternal Fleet, but it was precisely because of their research operations that they were resisted in the process of encountering multiple different civilized empires. As for what their future will be like, you will be the witness of everything. \n\nThe above is the information we want to tell you, and we look forward to your next visit." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.c: "What about the Eternal Fleet?" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.c.res: "They are ancient artificial intelligences from Iokas, an important military research center of the Infinite Empire. After developing intelligent artificial intelligence, Iokas quickly applied the technology to the field of war and created a large number of fleets. The Infinite Empire called it the Eternal Fleet. \n\nAfter the Eternal Fleet was created, it has always been the most powerful war machine. After the collapse of the Infinite Empire, it went through several twists and turns, and finally maintained the shaky situation of the Galactic Empire under the control of the Emperor of the Galactic Empire. Unfortunately, after the death of the Emperor of the Empire, the Eternal Fleet was completely out of control, and the fleet had to initialize the agreement, that is, to annihilate all discovered civilized worlds. \n\nThere are many words in it that you don’t understand yet. Maybe one day, when you look back, you will understand it all. Looking forward to your next visit." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.d: "Then do you know $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$?" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.d.res: "$Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ is a warlord oligarchic government formed after the collapse and split of the Galactic Empire. Compared with $Name_kuat$, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ is actually the representative of the Empire. After the death of the emperor, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ has a great voice in the coalition government. \n\nThe rise of $Name_kuat$ made $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ feel a crisis, so $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ decided to infiltrate and weaken $Name_kuat$. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ secretly pushed the Endodia Empire to contact the Eternal Fleet and led it to go to war with $Name_kuat$. The Endodia Empire was obviously not $Name_kuat$'s opponent. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ entered the star region where the Endodia Empire was located in the name of mediating the war. \n\nAt the same time, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ infiltrated $Name_kuat$ and tried to obtain corresponding collection data from it to advance their understanding of the Eternal Fleet. \n\nYour destiny will also be in it. I look forward to your next visit." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.e: "Since there is an eternal fleet, is there an eternal empire?" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.e.res: "Fate is unpredictable. The Eternal Fleet is not the Eternal Empire. Perhaps your guess will come true. \n\nIs there anything else you want to know?" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.f: "You mentioned Infinite Empire earlier, so what is Infinite Empire?" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.f.res: "The Infinite Empire was the first empire to unify the galaxy. The Rakata people used the Dark Force to develop powerful Force technology. By combining giant engineering beasts with the Dark Force, they created a stellar furnace that could seduce and corrupt people's hearts. Therefore, the Infinite Empire was also driven by the furnace to launch one invasion and expansion after another. Until its true peak, the Infinite Empire had become the largest galactic force. \n\nHowever, the arrival of the natural disaster broke everything for the Rakata people. This great plague caused the Rakata people to lose their powerful Dark Force. The Rakata people were no longer favored by the Dark Force, and the technology developed based on the Dark Force could not work. The Infinite Empire of the Rakata people quickly collapsed under the influence of the collapse of technology and the Force. But the Rakata people could not accept this fact. They took a different approach and tried to create a god, a technological god that they could fully master. \n\nInterestingly, the Infinite Empire succeeded. They created the Aries artificial intelligence of the Eternal Fleet. The artificial intelligence quickly led the Rakata people to a new peak. At this time, the Infinite Empire was stronger than ever. \n\nHowever, the artificial intelligence of the Eternal Fleet has evolved and iterated, and has acquired consciousness. They feel disgusted and resistant to the oppression of the Rakata people. \n\nFinally, the powder keg was finally detonated. When the Emperor of the Empire did not want to be impeached by the Parliament and ordered the Eternal Fleet to launch an attack on the Imperial Parliament, the Eternal Fleet launched a surprise attack on the Infinite Empire. Most of the planets of the Infinite Empire were quickly annihilated by the Eternal Fleet before the Rakata people could react, and other star regions were completely wiped out by the attacks launched by the Eternal Fleet stationed in the star regions. The arrogant Infinite Empire was thus destroyed. In the end, only some stubborn remnants remained sleeping in their former fortresses." #NT!

 kuat_legacy.104.h: "Who are you?" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.h.res: "We once were like you, stepping out from a primitive planet, establishing one government after another, creating one miracle after another. In the prosperity of matter, we lost ourselves, lost control of our souls, but we did not end there. We found our path, beyond that abyss, within the reality of the universe, we found the holy land that allowed us to be reborn. From the moment of our rebirth, we have become eternal, whether in the past, present, or future, who we are is no longer important.\n\nClearly, you enjoy our blessings, but blessings come at a price. We will reclaim everything." #NT!

 kuat_legacy.104.j: "What is hidden in the shield planet in the F star field?" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.j.res: "That planet was blocked by a civilization that no longer exists. Although the shield has been around for countless years, it is still very advanced for you. As for what is left inside, we don't know the details. \n\nWe have the ability to remove it, but it is impossible to control the world on the other side of the anchor point, so we did not interfere with the operation of the shield. Although that civilization no longer exists, their successors must still be watching here in this star zone. But don't worry, as of today they should no longer have any ability to respond to your actions." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.k: "How can I remove this shield?" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.k.res: "That civilization's research in the field of shields has reached a level that is unmatched by any other civilization, and this is just a simplified version of the shields commonly used by that civilization. We also have this technology and are very happy to provide it to you as long as you are willing to pay some price for it." #NT!

 kuat_legacy.104.l:0 "What is inside the anomalous waypoint sealed by the subspace energy?"
 kuat_legacy.104.l.res:0 "Subspace energy? You've discovered it, then. That place used to be the fleet logistics center of the Endodia Empire. Later, when the Endodia Empire was on the brink of defeat, it was taken over by a desperate resistance group. They gathered the energy from the subspace engines and attempted to trigger a subspace energy explosion to seal the entire star system.\n\nIt's surprising that it has only held for 4 millennia and is about to fail. Perhaps there are still Endodians surviving inside. If you wish to bring this star system back to light, you can transmit your data to us and pay the price you should. We will give you an answer soon."

 kuat_legacy.117.desc: "Our research ship discovered a mysterious ancient shield planet in the F star field. Any attempt to penetrate the surface of the shield planet has failed. According to the report of the scientific research department, this shield may be related to an unknown pioneer civilization. \n\nSince we don't know what is hidden under the shield, our scientific research team recommends not to take any action on this shield planet for the time being. Perhaps the abyss anchor point in the middle of the galaxy will answer some questions about this shield planet for us." #NT!

 kuat_legacy.119.title: "Technological breakthrough" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.119.desc: "We have obtained this powerful shield defense system and completed the ship adaptation work, but due to the advanced nature of this shield for our current technological level, and the lack of necessary isotope-5, even though we have mastered its theory, we still cannot fully reproduce the function of the shield. However, we are not without gains, and now these shield defense systems will maintain the combat efficiency of our ships.\n\nWe can now deactivate the shield on the shielded planet of $Name_F_1$." #NT!

 kuat_legacy.120.desc: "With the help of the knowledge provided by the descendants, our scientific research team successfully removed the shield wrapped around the F star field shield planet with the help of the most advanced equipment in the empire. Just as the researchers were excitedly preparing to scan the surface of the planet under the shield, the scientific research ship still on standby in the planet's orbit suddenly discovered two unidentified ships taking off from the surface of the planet. It seems that the removal of the shield awakened these long-sleeping souls. We have never seen a ship with such an appearance before. The ship has a complete structure and obvious modular characteristics. \n\nFor easy identification, we named the two ships "St Nicolas Abbey" and "St Mark's Basilica". While we were trying to contact the channel of the ship and mobilizing the defense forces of the local galaxy to deal with its possible reaction, the two ships suddenly started their jump engines and disappeared in front of the researchers. Since we cannot track the coordinates of the other party's jump destination, we can only guard against possible threats while continuing to explore the planet. \n\nBecause the environment of this planet is too harsh, we need to complete some infrastructure construction before we can continue exploring the planet." #NT!

These signals can be confirmed as some civilization relics with certain exploration value. It seems that these civilizations were destroyed by the strongest force in the Milky Way today, "$Name_kuat$", and $Name_kuat$ is deliberately concealing all of this. Everything seems so unnatural.

 kuat_legacy.3.desc: "After the Imperial research ship slowly landed on the surface of the planet, [leader.GetName] led her researchers to conduct routine camp layout and safety inspections around the planet, and found that there were some unnatural places on the planet. The planet's ecological environment here is too good, but there are no large species populations, which may indicate that the planet's environment has been transformed. The planet's magnetic field and gravity form a resonance mode different from other planets, and this mode of resonance constantly releases a special tachyon signal. [leader.GetName] decided to lead her research team to conduct a complete investigation of the planet. \n\nThe investigation of the planet showed that it was not a habitable planet with a good ecosystem. This shows that the planet has undergone some changes, perhaps related to the resonance mode of the tachyon signal caused by the unique gravity change. [leader.GetName] has begun to look for the source of the tachyon signal." #NT!

However, when [leader.GetName] scanned the surface of the planet, he found some unnatural stone buildings in the mountains, but the scan of the planet showed that there was no life on the planet. \n\nAccording to the investigation of our researchers, in the detection feedback of our detectors, [leader.GetName] found that the closer to these ancient buildings, the stronger the signal. Excluding the influence of the planet's unique magnetic field interference and other unexpected factors, it is highly likely that the source of this signal should be related to this lost building complex, which is very beneficial for our further investigation." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.4.a: "This must be investigated thoroughly." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.5.title: "§EStrange signal§!" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.5.desc: "[leader.GetName] and her team, with the help of our advanced and sophisticated instruments, managed to approach and reach the vicinity of the stone building complex. Based on the spatial distribution of the surrounding geographical information, [leader.GetName] believes that the building complex here is artificially built, and the scale of the building should not support a large number of people living. It is very likely that it is a camp built by a group of ancient exiles. Analysis of the surrounding environment shows that the building complex was built a long time ago and its stability can no longer be guaranteed. \n\nAfter [leader.GetName] and her team managed to stabilize these buildings, they determined the location of the signal based on the feedback from the detector. Our researchers determined that the signal came from the tower building in the center of the ancient building complex where they were located. The crystal light shining on the tower-shaped spire can still be vaguely seen. \n\nBut after [leader.GetName] approached, the surrounding gravity changed. The builders of the site seemed to simulate the planet's gravity and conduct experiments here. Our research team could not directly remove the crystal. \n\nAlthough we could not directly remove the gravity crystal, [leader.GetName] did not gain nothing. We found two architectural design drawings and a digitized planetary planning design drawing in the database. What we can be sure of is that the ancient experimental data we have found may help us unlock the secret of the existence of this crystal." #NT!

 kuat_legacy.6.desc: "After [leader.GetName] cracked the mechanical equipment in the ruins, he found some surprising reports recorded in it, which helped our researchers shut down the gravity reaction device in the facility. \n\n[leader.GetName] used the tachyon signal reaction of the gravity device in the building to successfully shut down the special resonance-guided gravity device. After the gravity facility was shut down, our researchers easily removed the crystal. What surprised us was that after removing the crystal, [leader.GetName] resonated with the crystal, which allowed her to see the echo of the past. Although it was very short, this information is still extremely important to us. \n\nAccording to [leader.GetName]'s report, the resonance content was the last scene of the destruction of the rich and powerful civilization planet to which the builder of this facility belonged: \n\nIn the vast deep space, a large number of star destroyers from $Name_kuat$ gathered, and these ships easily tore through the planet's defenses. After their endless bombardment, there was almost no intact terrain on the entire planet." #NT!

 Kuat_structure_2: "The atmosphere of this gas planet is extremely unstable, which has a very negative impact on our research. \n\nThe probe we sent finally entered the atmosphere of this gas planet and began to conduct various observations and sampling. However, as soon as it entered the atmosphere, the probe frequently encountered strong airflow shocks and electromagnetic field disturbances, all systems were paralyzed, and lost contact with the outside world. When the probe was back online, everything seemed to be back to normal, but the instrument records showed that during the short period of loss of contact, various elements within the atmosphere had undergone drastic changes, which was completely beyond our expectations. \n\nTherefore, we should investigate this gas planet in depth!" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.7.title: "Research Breakthrough" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.7.desc: "[leader.GetName]'s research team has begun to gradually promote the investigation of crystal clues from the ancient database. \n\n"Why can this crystal from the ruins store the memory echoes of the past?" The research team has a deep interest in this question. This crystal seems to have some kind of artificially designed information storage and regeneration function, which can record and reproduce everything that happens in its surrounding environment. In fact, the surface of the crystal is covered with extremely fine lines and nodes, which may be some kind of ultra-high-density information processing and recording system. Cracking the working mechanism of this system may allow us to understand the technological heyday of this ancient civilization. \n\n"And where did the fleet in the memory echo come from? What is the origin of the owner of this planet?" These are the goals that the team will focus on exploring next. The origin of the fortress fleet is still a mystery, but they have powerful weapons that are enough to destroy a planet. This must be a rich and advanced alien civilization. The builders of this planet are also mysterious. Only by continuing to crack the database and the memory of the crystal can their true colors be revealed. \n\nThere are still quite a few questions to be answered, but I believe that through the continued study of the crystal, the team will soon be able to reproduce more past events on this planet, and piece together the true history of this civilization, and its ultimate fate. At the same time, they will also begin to crack the technical principles of the crystal itself, which will undoubtedly be a key way to gain a deeper understanding of this ancient wisdom civilization. I believe that [leader.GetName]'s team will be able to uncover all the secrets left by this database and give us a deeper understanding of the universe. \n\nAlthough there is still a long way to go in the research work, there is already light at the end of the tunnel.

 kuat_legacy.8.desc: "After our [leader.GetName] day and night research, we can now glimpse the tip of the iceberg of the secrets of this crystal. \n\nThe crystal is a tool that transmits information to the contactor through a material form called the Force. This Force seems to exist in a certain dimension of the universe and has the ability to transmit various information and vision. By resonating with the crystal, the research team can see various events and information captured and recorded by this Force. \n\nAnd the crystal still does not record the origin of the fortress fleet in the echo we give us. This may mean that when the fortress fleet attacked this planet, the crystal was not in an activated state and could not record the event, which also deepened our confusion about the identity of the fortress fleet. \n\nHowever, this crystal brought us a new echo, which showed us an ordinary gas planet, which is guiding us to the next target. Is this gas planet related to the maker of the crystal? Is there a similar information storage device that may be able to answer more questions we care about? \n\nThe research team decided to follow the clues provided by the crystal and explore this gas planet. Through the interstellar positioning system, we quickly locked onto a gaseous planet that met the characteristics, just a few jump points away from our home star system. It seems that the crystal seems to be guiding us to gradually uncover the mystery of the Endodia Empire and its connection with various celestial bodies. \n\nLet us wait and see what surprises the research team's new discoveries will bring us.

 kuat_legacy.9.desc: "Our researchers successfully entered the outer orbit of this planet, but the detectors of our spacecraft in orbit were seriously disturbed by the storm raging on the planet. The storm on this gaseous planet is extremely strong. Under the influence of the storm, the planet's atmosphere is in an unstable state, which is obviously not suitable for our landing shuttle to transport our researchers to land. \n\nHowever, [leader.GetName] analyzed the statistical information on the changes in the trajectory of the planet's storm collected by our ships in orbit through comprehensive scanning and detection of the planet and found that the storm of this star has a circular motion trajectory. The movement of the storm is chaotic but orderly. There seems to be something in the center that is blocking the signal of our scanning and guiding the movement of the entire storm. \n\n[leader.GetName] believes that this is the strangest place and the place with the smallest storm. If we want to continue to investigate the cause of this abnormal phenomenon, we can only conduct investigations in these places. \n\nThis is a very interesting discovery. The seemingly violent and disordered storm on the surface of this gaseous planet is actually not completely random, but revolves around a certain center point. This shows that the formation and development of the storm must be driven or guided by some unknown factors. The blocking of the scanning signal by the center of the storm also indicates that there is a high probability of some kind of artificial structure there. \n\n[leader.GetName]'s judgment is very accurate. The center of the storm is undoubtedly the best landing point for our in-depth investigation. Once the storm weakens, we should immediately send a shuttle to transport scientific researchers here to conduct direct exploration of the area. If there is indeed some kind of hidden artificial structure there, then the key to solving the mystery of this gaseous planet is in our hands. \n\nLet us look forward to the next action. I believe that [leader.GetName] will make the right decision to lead us to uncover the mystery of this planet and find a way to the truth. Scientific researchers will also overcome various difficulties and complete this critical task." #NT!

 kuat_legacy.10.desc: "[leader.GetName] led her team to the center of the storm and conducted a planetary investigation there. After her team successfully arrived at the center of the storm, they found that there seemed to be a huge floating building in the center of the storm that our detector could not scan. The atmospheric storm layout of this gaseous planet is different from the conventional one. The storm of this planet has always been around the huge floating building in the center. The whole building is motionless under the storm. It is obvious that we should be looking for this place. \n\n[leader.GetName] decided to lead her team to the floating building in the center of the storm. She found that this huge floating building still has intact building facilities. The structure of these facilities is quite stable. The entire floating building releases high-energy particle flow through the control of the storm to interfere with the detection signal in space. But strangely, our scientific research team did not find any signs of life in this fortress. \n\nAfter an in-depth investigation, the research team found that there is a relatively well-preserved landing platform on the upper level of the floating city. Although it is impossible to go directly from the bottom, our researchers successfully reached the upper landing platform with the help of our shuttle. There are some strange words on the ground of the upper platform, and our researchers have successfully analyzed the meaning of the words: Cloud City. Our researchers decided to go to the central tower to find out. \n\nThis is a major discovery. This floating building "Cloud City" obviously has the ability to guide and control the surrounding storms, which also explains why the storms are stable around it. Although the facilities of "Cloud City" are well preserved, there are no signs of life, which indicates that it should be some kind of automatic control system that is still in operation. \n\nThe text on the landing platform confirmed our guess that the name of this huge building is "Cloud City". The research team decided to explore its central tower, where it is very likely that the core part of the control of the storm and the automatic system exists. If we can crack the control system of "Cloud City", we can not only have a deeper understanding of the technology of the Endodia Empire, but also help us continue to explore this gaseous planet. \n\nLet us wait and see the new discoveries of [leader.GetName] and the research team. They will definitely bring us more surprises, unravel the mysteries of this mysterious "Cloud City", and take an important step towards revealing the truth of this planet." #NT!

According to the recent report provided by our investigation team, this tower is closely related to the storms raging on the planet. \n\nAfter in-depth investigation, we found that there are no signs of life here, but the machines in the tower are still running, which are what make the storms raging on the planet. After going deep into the Cloud City facilities, we found that there are a large number of ancient computing devices arranged here. These ancient devices are very similar to the computing devices we use now, and they are still working normally. \n\n[leader.GetName] decided to try and obtain the data in the computing devices. But the computing devices were encrypted in some way, and our researchers need some time to process them. \n\nThis once again confirmed our speculation that the initiator of "Cloud City" has extremely high technological capabilities, and these ancient and mysterious computing devices are still dominating the formation and development of atmospheric storms. We must crack the encryption system of these devices and obtain the control codes and data in them. This is undoubtedly the key to understanding the truth of "Cloud City". \n\n[leader.GetName]'s decision is extremely wise. These computing devices store a large amount of information. Once the encryption is cracked, we will be able to reproduce the past operation of "Cloud City" and even find a way to shut down the storm system. The research team will do their best to crack the codes on these ancient devices as soon as possible so that we can truly enter its operating system and gain control. \n\nThis is a very challenging task, but the chances of success are huge. Once we control the computing network of "Cloud City", we will become the masters of this gaseous planet and can explore every corner of it at will without being hindered by the storm. I believe that [leader.GetName] and the research team must have a deep understanding of this. They will definitely overcome difficulties with their tenacious will and scientific and technological wisdom and complete the mission of exploring "Cloud City". \n\nLet us wait and see the good news they bring. The ancient legacy left by this mysterious civilization will soon be presented to us, and the mysteries of the universe will be revealed step by step." #NT!

This facility will be used to protect our people so that our compatriots can successfully survive this disaster.\n\nBut this shelter alone is not enough. We need a large number of shelters, but for now we have to separate and isolate each other. They will find us sooner or later. We must organize as soon as possible. Our enemies will not let us go. The compromise agreement did not save us at all. They are still hunting us. I don’t know how long the traces we left here can last. Forget the past. The power of the past is like smoke in the past. Our future is already dark§!. \n\nThe video stopped abruptly, and the dilapidated equipment in the facility finally came to the end of its life after a long time. \n\nBecause of the damage to the computing equipment running in the central tower, the storm on this planet has undergone tremendous changes. The storm began to get out of control, and the entire complex was no longer safe. If our scientists do not leave here quickly, their lives may be in danger!\n\nThis video reveals the true identity of the builders of "Cloud City" and their original intention to build this facility. Obviously, this is a group of refugees fleeing from the disaster, and "Cloud City" is the shelter they built to avoid being hunted down. But as time goes by, the control system of "Cloud City" fails, and the storm begins to get out of control, threatening the safety of the entire building. \n\n[leader.GetName]'s judgment is accurate, and the research team must evacuate "Cloud City" immediately. They have obtained enough information to understand the fate of this ancient civilization, and "Cloud City" has become a relic hidden in danger. Now the priority is to ensure the safe retreat of the research team. We cannot risk sacrificing lives for further exploration. \n\nLet us pray for the research team, hoping that they can successfully escape the shackles of the storm and return safely. The truth of this ancient civilization has been revealed to us. Although there are still some mysteries, we have seen the tip of the iceberg. This is a very successful exploration.

The calmness on the surface is likely to be a disguise to cover up the secrets of the core structure. We cannot determine what kind of civilization created this planet, but they have powerful technology to transform the core of the planet, which is enough to shock us. \n\nAlthough the detection results did not find other abnormal signs, this is already a major discovery. [leader.GetName] should be given enough time to explore this planet in depth and find the reasons and purposes for the changes in the core.

These materials still lack a lot of clues, and the fog of the truth about $misc_system_desc$ is still very thick. \n\nIn the first stage, after investigating the planet Gaia, which once belonged to the Endodia Empire, we obtained the key information that led us to find these clues - a strange crystal. \n\nAnd this crystal led us to the gas planet shelter and ocean planet research institute built by the Endodia Empire. They built shelters and research institutes in these areas to avoid some enemies they had faced that were far beyond their imagination and made them powerless to resist. \n\nAccording to the results of the investigation of $misc_system_desc$, this fortress world, as an important research base of the Endodia Empire, provided great help for them to resist $Name_kuat$. However, it is obvious that these struggles are in vain. $Name_kuat$ easily crushed the resistance of the Endodia Empire, and the information left by the Endodia Empire researchers stationed in $misc_system_desc$ indicated that they were heading for destruction. \n\nBut in addition to the clues to the unfinished technology of the Endodia Empire obtained from this information, we also found some noteworthy clues. $Name_kuat$ did not seem to be the enemy of the Endodia Empire at the beginning, but the owner of $misc_system_desc$ did something that caused the relationship between the two sides to deteriorate rapidly, and then the war broke out. \nWhat kind of thing can cause the two sides who have cooperated for many years to fight each other?

The facilities on both planets were built by the civilization to try to resist the enemies they faced. $misc_system_desc_2$ is much better preserved than the previous facilities. Our researchers have determined that the system where the facility is located has not experienced the fierce battles that broke out in the previous system, which also explains why we can find relatively complete technical data here. \n\nSecondly, judging from the data left by the AI ​​and virtual information in the facilities of $misc_system_desc_2$, the experience of this civilization and these legacy technologies are related to the truth of this war. Perhaps the empire that once destroyed the Endodia Empire is still watching us in deep space. \n\nFinally, after analyzing the acquired technology, our researchers found that the ship was a special warship that the Endodia Empire tried to develop to resist the enemies they faced. Our researchers found through testing samples that this warship could interfere with the enemy's weapons to a certain extent, making it impossible for it to penetrate the shields and armor of its own fleet. However, this technological product was a step late after all. The warships developed by the Endodia Empire did not become their life-saving straw, and the defeat on the front line could not make the research results work. While these ships were still being tested, the Endodia Empire had collapsed, their research facilities were all occupied, and finally completely destroyed by $Name_kuat$. \n\nIn general, our researchers have obtained part of the truth, but if we want to know the reason why the two sides fought, we still need to continue investigating." #NT!

Not only did we make rapid progress in the search for the source of the signal, we also discovered some interesting situations. \n\nThe traces of ruins and the remaining energy levels in this star ring structure area show that this is different from the signal reflected by the information flow pattern collected by each country in the Milky Way. The strong energy reaction seems to be the result of a planetary orbital bombardment that we are currently unknown. Since we have not obtained the information of the Lost Empire, perhaps they will know what these things are. \n\nBased on the reaction results, the internal structure of the entire star ring is in an unstable state of equilibrium, but it may collapse at any time. \n\nWhen studying these strange energy reactions, [leader.GetName] found that the tachyon signals received by the instrument are very similar to these energy signals after being transformed through a 7200 baud periodic law. Where the signal is the strongest, stands a strange spire building." #NT!

 kuat_legacy.54.desc: "After arriving at the spire, [leader.GetName] and her team blew open the door of the ancient building. As our scientific research team went deeper, the reaction of the instrument became stronger and stronger. According to the structural analysis of this ancient spire, it should be an administrative or scientific research center of the Endodia Empire, and it must be an important facility. The structure inside the spire is very complex, and some kind of defense system is arranged. Fortunately, the ruins have been severely damaged, and these remaining defense systems are completely ineffective. \n\n[leader.GetName] and her scientific research team wandered around the ancient spire ruins that were as complicated as a maze for a long time, and finally found a closed door. The dust on this door has completely covered its original appearance, and its hardness makes it difficult for us to break it. Just when [leader.GetName] was at a loss, the door produced a very strong vibration, and then slowly opened under the control of some force, allowing us to see the inside of the facility. There is a central control AI inside the facility, which opened the door to allow our scientists to enter the facility. \n\nWhen we entered the central control room, the mechanical facilities and server clusters in the center of the ruins began to flash lights. A mechanical voice echoed in the ruins:\n\nWelcome to the ship design database. According to the data module analysis, the database has been running for 7199 epochs. The storage module will stop running after 1 epoch, and data transfer is required. Applying for data open permission to the main control terminal... The main control system connection failed, enabling the backup protocol and scanning for outsider information. Enable data acquisition mode and start transmitting data streams.\n\n[leader.GetName] told this AI about our origins. Surprisingly, the main control AI of this ruin allowed us to access their database after knowing our origins. The contents of the database tell us that this was once a ship design facility, a laboratory set up by the Endodia Empire to study the ship technology it introduced. Although it was still well preserved after the demise of the Endodia Empire, a lot of technical information was lost. We can only extract part of the content. After transmitting this part of the information to us, the AI system of the facility was completely shut down and fell asleep in this ruin with its creator." #NT!

According to the surrounding radiation energy index, the reading after 7200 cycles of transformation is still different from the energy information flow detected in the instrument. There should still be some secrets hidden in this relic. \n\nAfter the hard work of the scientific research team, we found a huge energy reaction under the server cluster in the laboratory, and this energy is very similar to the effect of our data signal flow after periodic transformation. [leader.GetName] and her team found a slightly concave stone on a stone wall behind the server cluster. When she pressed it, the server cluster seemed to be lifted up by some kind of gravity generator as the relic vibrated, revealing the entrance to the passage below. \nAfter we carefully walked into the passage, we found that it was a long and narrow passage, and at the end of the passage there was a unique temple building, which should be behind the spire.

The transmission distance of this signal source is not long, which is why the value displayed by the receiver in space is very weak. After going deep into the temple, our research team found that the internal structure here is very different from the outside. The dilapidated outside may be to cover up some important secrets. \n\nAfter our research team went deep into the center of the temple, they found that they seemed to have entered an ancient database. The stone building walls and the large number of test instruments and test devices that seemed to be intact here were out of place. [leader.GetName] tried to open a central server. When she was about to crack the password, the computer automatically opened the access rights of the server. This should be the data access rights opened by the previous AI management system. \n\nAfter trying to analyze the data information of the server group, our research team successfully obtained some blueprints and a virtual video image. After turning on the video device, a blurred image of a girl gradually appeared in front of [leader.GetName]:\n\nFriends, the fact that you can stand here means that you have obtained this technology blueprint. This is the database information from <error>. Although there is no confidential content of <error> here, I believe this information is still useful. Take it and don't mention your gains to anyone. <error> has been monitoring us...\n\nAfter the image said all this, the data laboratory returned to silence. With the prompt sound of data transmission completion, [leader.GetName] and her team will also return to the orbital ship safely. \n\nThere may still be some secrets hidden here.

Who is this civilization fighting with...\n\nAfter arriving at the central square, our scientific research team found that the source of the signal seemed to be underground. The interior of the high-rise building cannot be detected by instruments, but perhaps the surface can be drilled from the dried lake bed in the central square. \n\n[leader.GetName] applied to us for a large number of engineering machinery and started excavation work. A collapse occurred during the excavation from the riverbed to the underground. Fortunately, the engineering machinery and scientific researchers were not injured.

Due to the long-term deep underground burial, the facilities here have not suffered much damage. After searching and analyzing the site based on the energy reaction, we found a strange spherical facility in what seemed to be the control center. When [leader.GetName] approached the facility, the energy reaction of the facility and the energy reaction of the instrument produced some resonance, the spherical facility was activated, and a huge screen was projected.

Our research found that this ring facility is very similar to the ring facility in $Name_kuat$'s capital, and was originally intended to be used as a residential area. But these ring worlds are closed, which is very unusual. Sure enough, under the ring world, we found a ruin. After exploring the ruins, scientists judged that the style of this ruin is different from $Name_kuat$, and is closer to the ruins of the Endodia Empire. This means that there may be some valuable information hidden in the ruins. \n\nWe successfully found the last legacy of the Endodia Empire sealed by $Name_kuat$, as well as the projection message from Endodia. From this, we learned that Endodia had defeated $Name_kuat$ and the Eternal Fleet, but ultimately lost to $Name_kuat$. In addition, hidden behind $Name_kuat$'s rule is another crisis - these outsiders once inadvertently protected our world, but their motives are still unclear and we cannot take it lightly. \n\nTherefore, if we choose to betray $Name_kuat$, these eternal fleets may become the biggest threat.

We should perhaps re-evaluate our relationship with $Name_kuat$. If we choose to be hostile to $Name_kuat$, it will be difficult for us to deal with the eternal fleet from an unknown world. \n\nIn the Endodia legacy, we also found the design drawings of the Eclipse I-type star dreadnought, which they obtained from $Name_kuat$.

We will give you the answer to this war. \n\nThe Eternal Fleet, like us, does not belong to this star field. We came because of eternity, and we will only leave because of eternity. We don't know exactly where the Eternal Fleet belongs to. Our former emperor brought back a huge fully automatic combat system from an unknown star field, which he called Eternity. \n\nThe fleet equipped with this fully automatic combat system is completely under the command of the emperor, unless the emperor dies. But reality is so interesting. Although we have powerful power, we can't escape the arrangement of fate. In the civil war of our empire, the emperor and the throne disappeared forever in the energy of the battleship reactor, and chaos began. It took a lot of time to complete the reorganization after the collapse of the imperial government, which also made the Eternal Fleet out of the control of the empire. \n\nAlthough the empire can no longer control the Eternal Fleet, for us, these things are not enough for the new imperial government to pay attention to. We have fully mastered the technology of the Eternal Fleet, and their existence is no longer valuable. These roving Eternal Fleets are just a boring farce to us and the Empire, but they are a disaster to you.

But they were eventually confused by the desire for power and strength. These ancient civilizations began to study psychic energy and the so-called virtual realm. These irrational desires eventually brought them destruction. Although the ancient civilizations successfully resisted the influence of the virtual realm at first, they eventually lost to their own hands. \n\nIn the final analysis, they are just crabs in a bamboo basket. They only care about internal strife and never pay attention to the real threat. The dark cloud of the Eternal Fleet has shrouded this place until we brought light, stability and prosperity to the entire galaxy. After the destruction of the ancient civilization, we established outposts and supply stations here. As the price of our protection of these natives, they need to pay for our supplies. This is a fair trade. After all, even the ants' survival is a reward from the strong. \n\nIt's a pity that the game of power and desire is repeated again, blinding their eyes again and making them forget their identity. The Endodia Empire launched a shameless invasion challenge against us. Although they were seeking their own death, our kind parliament still showed them mercy, and the fire of Endodia was allowed to be preserved. \n\nAs I said before, what has been done will be done again, and there will always be challengers in this area. We are tired of this boring game, so we plan to put on a grand show, and you have successfully allowed us to complete the arrangement of this final performance. \n\nWe approve you to be the fireworks for the opening of this show.

With the Eternal Fleet in other areas completely destroyed, our progress has made the Imperial government dissatisfied, and the reason for all this is you lowly natives. We once selected agents here to let them arrange signal relay stations for us. \n\nThe initial plan went smoothly, and three relay stations were successfully surrounded in this star region. But the stupid Endodia hindered all this. They gave the Eternal Fleet a chance to survive and also brought shame to us in the Imperial Parliament. Endodia must be held responsible for what they did, so their country perished. We are different from you inferior races who don't know how to be grateful. Even if you try to challenge our authority, Endodia was eventually retained. \n\nAlthough fools always try to hinder our plans, how can the power of mayflies shake the towering trees. According to the plan, we will deploy three relay stations, and will start them when you challenge our majesty. The Eternal Fleet in this area will be attracted by the signal and gather here, and you will have the most direct conflict with the Eternal Fleet. \n\nWhen the dust settles, we will use the magnetic field characteristics of the tachyon signal caused by the relay station to let our base lock this star field, and then wipe out this star area and the boring Eternal Fleet. \n\nDance to your heart's content, this fireworks will soon bloom its glory, and you can still enjoy the last moment of carnival." #NT!

You can easily obtain powerful weapons and advanced technology, no matter how rare and terrible these abilities are, and can even make your enemies disappear without any warning. Even the Eternal Fleet is just some scrap metal and dust in front of you. \n\nBut the Eternal Fleet, like us, does not belong to this star field. We came because of eternity, and we will only leave because of eternity. We don't know exactly where the Eternal Fleet belongs. Our former emperor brought back a huge fully automatic combat system from an unknown star field. He called it eternity. The fleet equipped with this fully automatic combat system is completely under the command of the emperor, unless the emperor dies. \n\nEven though you have powerful power, you can't escape the arrangement of fate. During the civil war in our empire, the emperor and the throne disappeared forever in the energy of the battleship reactor, and chaos began. After the fall of the imperial government, it took a long time to reorganize, which also made the eternal fleet out of the control of the empire. \n\nAlthough the empire can no longer control the eternal fleet, for us, these things are not enough for the new imperial government to pay attention to. We have completely mastered the technology of the eternal fleet, and their existence is no longer valuable. These wandering eternal fleets are just a boring farce for us and the empire, but they are a disaster for you.

However, they were confused by the power they controlled and actually studied the so-called virtual realm. These irrational desires eventually brought them destruction. \n\nIn the final analysis, they are just crabs in a bamboo basket. They only care about internal strife and never pay attention to the real threat. The dark cloud of the Eternal Fleet has shrouded this place until we brought light, security and prosperity to the entire galaxy. After the destruction of the ancient civilization, we established outposts and supply stations here. As the price of our protection of these natives, they need to pay for our supplies. \n\nThis is a fair trade. After all, even the ants are rewarded by the strong for being alive. It's a pity that the game of power and desire is repeated again, blinding their eyes once again and making them forget their identity. The Endodia Empire launched a shameless invasion challenge against us. Although they are seeking their own death, our benevolent parliament still showed them mercy and allowed the fire of Endodia to be preserved. \n\nAs I said before, what has been done will be done again, and there will always be challengers in this area. We are tired of this boring game, so we planned to put on a grand show, but you actually succeeded in defeating part of our fleet and solving the threat of the Eternal Fleet in this area.

The initial plan went smoothly, and three relay stations were successfully surrounded in this star region. But the stupid Endodia hindered all this. They gave the Eternal Fleet a chance to survive and also brought shame to us in the Imperial Parliament. Endodia must be held responsible for what they did, so their country perished. We are different from you inferior races who don't know how to be grateful. Even if you try to challenge our authority, Endodia was eventually retained. \n\nAlthough fools always try to hinder our plans, how can the power of mayflies shake the towering trees. According to the plan, we will deploy three relay stations and activate them when you challenge our authority. The Eternal Fleet in this area will be attracted by the signal and gather here, and you will have the most direct conflict with the Eternal Fleet. \n\nWhen the dust settles, we will use the magnetic field characteristics of the tachyon signal caused by the relay station to let our base lock this star field, and then wipe out this star area and the boring Eternal Fleet. \n\nIt's a pity that we failed and you succeeded." #NT!

The initial detection of the drone showed that the space behind the door is quite huge and has a variety of mysterious electronic equipment. Strangely, most of the electronic equipment is turned off or damaged. Only a giant column in the center of the facility and the emergency green lights throughout the facility continue to work. \n\nFurther exploration is undoubtedly necessary.

According to the data core content found in a cabin suspected to be a regional management center, the builder here is a civilization called the Endodia Empire. Because they were involved in a huge war and the battlefield situation was already precarious, this civilization tried to revive in the future and built ten permanent shelters. \n\nAs one of the ten shelters built later, it shoulders multiple responsibilities such as a large resource storage station, a refugee shelter, and an environmental transformation facility for the future implementation of Gaia planet transformation. However, according to the administrative text on the core, the shelter occupancy plan, which was supposed to proceed step by step, had to be stopped abruptly due to some extremely mysterious reasons, and all subsequent related data were artificially erased and could never be restored. \n\nAlong with these precious data, the race and country name of this race, as well as all detailed information about their imperial history, were also erased. \n\nIf you want to know what happened to this empire, it is imperative to decipher the central hub with extremely strict encryption measures." #NT!

Finally, after countless days and nights of long torture, our decryption work has finally made a key breakthrough, and the permissions of some central data storage libraries have finally been opened to us. \n\nHowever, when we began to check the unlocked parts of the database with great expectations, we only got large pieces of extremely damaged data files. Among them, almost all humanities documents were destroyed, and only the scientific and technological documents that were equivalent to or slightly ahead of our current technological level were preserved. \n\nOur data analysis specialists speculated that in order to prevent their last legacy from being completely exposed to some kind of threat, this civilization most likely designed a data destruction program to prevent a country from following their footsteps after obtaining their knowledge. \n\nIn desperation, in order to obtain all the data that is expected to remain and full control of this facility, our analysis must continue.

Finally, with the last data module completely decrypted, we have obtained full authority over this facility. \n\nJust as we expected before, the massive amount of scientific and technological documents in the database used to revive the empire were destroyed by the central computer during the anti-decryption process, and the remaining part was only a step above our current technology. As for all the documents related to the humanities and administration of the empire, except for a few file sets that escaped due to omissions or other reasons, all others were deleted cleanly, without even a trace of dregs left. \n\nOur researchers began to examine these lucky survivors with disappointment.

The entire facility is just as $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ said, a giant battle fortress built by an unknown force called the First Order. \n\nBecause the planet has a large amount of Kyber crystals stored, the First Order decided to use the special function of Kyber crystals to enable it to guide stellar energy to strike a target across the galaxy. The data here record the demise of this civilization. This force seems to be easily destroyed by the $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ forces we drove away. Almost most of their fleets were destroyed by $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$'s fleet, and their territories and weapons facilities were almost annexed. \n\nSo we finally defeated $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ and mastered this super weapon facility.

Preliminary analysis of this shield shows that it can achieve small-scale folding and deflection of space. \n\nAt the same time, our engineering team has learned from the lessons of rashly deciphering the database content to trigger the deletion mechanism many times, and successfully saved some information in the data. Among them, our researchers found that the protection procedures used by this facility and the previous facilities are the same specifications, that is, these facilities use this deflection shield generator to produce a small-scale distortion effect on the surrounding magnetic field and space-time, and can cause the intruders and attack targets to be displaced and deflected within the range of the shield generator to achieve the purpose of protecting themselves. \n\nWe have discovered this technology in a facility that once belonged to the Endodia Empire. Currently, our researchers are not sure whether this technology came from the Endodia Empire or whether the Endodia Empire's technology came from $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, but as of now, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ has used this technology in the preserved facilities to achieve the purpose of protecting certain information in the facilities." #NT!

Our researchers found a huge black stone tablet in the center of the cave hall here. These stone tablets gave guidance to some of our members who can feel the Force. Just as our members stepped forward to touch the stone tablet, the pit shook violently, and the black stone tablet split from the middle and began to move slowly to both sides, revealing a huge arched facility suspected to be a server blocked by the black stone tablet. \n\nJust as our researchers accessed the interface of this suspected server facility, the black stone tablet shook again and began to slowly close, and some of our researchers were inevitably locked in the stone tablet. \n\nWith the passage of 7 sidereal days, our scientific researchers still have no way to deal with this black stone tablet, and the researchers who were wrapped in it have not been heard from so far.

This creature has no facial features and looks like a decayed corpse. However, the detector installed on the warship showed that it still has some unknown signs of life. \n\nWe immediately captured it and conducted a detailed study. Surprisingly, this seems to be a carbon-based life form artificially composed of countless stem cells. Perhaps it is more appropriate to call it a carbon-based robot, which has a completely different scientific research route from the silicon-based robots we have been studying. And in its body, we found that there are still some unknown energy sources remaining, which seem to still maintain its current operation. Perhaps this is why our detector can still detect signs of life in it. Perhaps we can try to study it more deeply. It may retain some past data for us to study. \n\nAfter our unremitting efforts, we finally found a way to scan the memory of this carbon-based robot. However, sadly, this robot seems to have been severely damaged, or perhaps it has undergone some special treatment, causing its data to be severely degraded, and we cannot read organized information from it. We will consider launching further follow-up research on its structure and composition, and perhaps we will encounter and study similar robots in the future, but the past and experience of this carbon-based mechanical robot will remain a mystery forever." #NT!

After analysis by our researchers, it seems that this civilization has never set foot in space, and has never even touched electricity. It is just a medieval civilization site. However, what is puzzling is that there are traces of nuclear radiation in these ruins, which is undoubtedly beyond the scope of cognition. After a long search, we found an object that recorded data of this civilization. After we analyzed and converted the information on it, we roughly understood that at the beginning, in a branch tribe of this civilization, someone accidentally discovered that a pond several kilometers away from the tribe would emit blue light at night. Not only that, as long as you touch the water of the pond, your whole body will fester and die, and this kind of death can also be transmitted to others through infection. In view of this, the chief of the tribe made a rule and announced that it was a cursed pond and no one could approach it. \n\nLater, foreign enemies invaded the tribe. Facing hostile forces, they splashed the water in the pond on the other side and successfully repelled the other side. The people who died under the curse showed the miserable condition. However, the people who were contaminated by the water in the pond also began to suffer from the terrible curse attack, and countless people fell one after another. \n\nUntil a wizard appeared, he found that by using certain specific minerals to make containers, he could effectively block the power of the curse. So he began to create an item called the container curse box. This box brought them a huge threat and began to threaten the surrounding tribes. If they did not obey his orders, they would be threatened by the curse. \n\nThe first feudal country that relied on nuclear deterrence was built, and the turning point of the fate of civilization was destined to emerge in the war. It seemed that the so-called cursed thing accidentally contaminated its water source during the war, and then extended to the entire planet, eventually leading to the demise of the entire civilization." #NT!

The impact caused by its violent explosion almost destroyed everything in the galaxy, and all the planets were shattered. This situation made remote detection basically impossible, so our investigation can only start from the star itself at close range. Our scientific research team had to start preparing radiation and heat-resistant equipment and began to investigate the star. \n\nBut there is very little information that can be obtained from the star itself. Just when our scientists were at a loss, some data showed that the existence of isotope-5 was detected in its material layer, and isotope-5 is theoretically impossible to appear on this star under natural conditions.

In the dark sky, the star no longer existed, and a star called a "white hole" appeared in the position of the past star, constantly releasing pale light. This star has only appeared in theory before, and there is no data to prove that it existed in the past. \n\nThis is undoubtedly a historic discovery, which makes our scientific research team very excited. Combined with our previous discoveries, the rare material of isotope-5 can not only be used to build powerful ships, but it can even change the properties of the planet. This conclusion has greatly improved our understanding of astrophysics. If this theory can be further developed, we may be able to master the technology of controlling stars. \n\nSince stars are the ultimate generators of energy and material throwers in the universe, their nuclear fusion and different life cycles constitute the basic elements of all real things. They provide extreme environments for matter/radiation and particles through extremely high fusion energy. \n\nOur new physics theory holds that the interior of a star is the ultimate creator of an infinite field of possibilities for matter and energy states.

This opens up the prospect of observing stars and star clusters, and entering the possibility field of alternative worlds through the distribution of matter and energy. With isotope-5, we can transform stars into the topological structure we need to navigate the cluster. This structure combines the distribution of luminosity, matter, gravity and energy, and is both a temporary state at present and the result of the evolution of the cluster over time. \n\nThis leads to another question. If white holes are topological structures transformed by isotope-5, then how can we use it to open up hidden possible worlds between and inside stars, and how will it affect the environment of the galaxy. If this theory is correct, then what can we expect from the manipulation of stars? And if this white hole was artificially transformed, then who did it and what was their purpose?

According to our researchers, this place is likely to have been occupied by a civilization as a warehouse for storing isotope-5, and some method was used to hide the coordinates of this galaxy, so that we have never discovered the existence of this galaxy.

After thousands of years of operation, due to unknown reasons, the ancient civilization died. They moved most of the facilities of the fortress through some unknown means, and in order to prevent anyone from discovering the isotope-5 stored here, they hid the coordinates of the galaxy from the star map. \n\nNot long ago, someone activated or destroyed the remaining facilities here, and a large amount of isotope-5 was injected into the star, causing a large-scale coronal mass ejection, and the star was transformed into a white hole; and the detection of the ancient life remains is even more incredible to our scientific research team. These bodies are like multiple different bodies spliced ​​together, with different DNA in different parts of the body, but the appearance is natural.

Part of the data mentioned a concept called "the abyss". After further analysis of this information, a new physics theory emerged that the interior of a star is the ultimate creator of the infinite possibility domain of matter and energy states. \n\nOne of our scientists even believes that if we want to control the evolution of stars, this technology should be able to observe and even navigate the topology of the quantum field of matter and energy states, or in other words: they may penetrate the main level of physical reality and dive into alternative worlds and realities. And this "alternative world" is the "abyss". \n\nThe abyss is a possible but currently unproven distribution of matter and energy. It is not a common concept of space-time folding like a wormhole. The abyss is a pocket in the field of uncertainty of reality at the quantum level. It is a possible, shadow pocket of alternative reality, an alternating distribution of stellar energy and matter. \n\nTherefore, the abyss may not be just a space-time phenomenon, but an enclave of uncertain space-time, a pocket of alternate reality, similar to the quantum effect field at the atomic level. \n\nHowever, since this theory will overturn all our conclusions about the universe, without the support of more data and experiments, our understanding of the abyss ends here.

They provide extreme environments for matter/radiation and particles through extremely high fusion energy. \n\nOur new physics theory believes that the interior of a star is the ultimate creator of the infinite possibility domain of matter and energy states.

The engineering is made possible by the combination of quantum possibility fields and star cluster topology. \n\nThis opens up the prospect of observing stars and star clusters and entering the possibility domain of alternative worlds through the distribution of matter and energy. With the help of isotope-5, we can transform stars into the topological structure we need to navigate the cluster. \n\nThis structure combines the distribution of luminosity, matter, gravity and energy. It is both a temporary state at present and the result of the evolution of the cluster over time. \n\nWe are fully capable of designing and building such a structure. The only problem is isotope-5.

 kuat_extramonster_expand.39.desc:0 "Our rail transit department recently discovered an abnormal waypoint during route exploration. Based on the data they uploaded, our research department conducted a thorough analysis. According to the analysis results, a large amount of subspace energy exists around the route trajectory. This energy seems to be attracted by the energy released from subspace engines, causing it to appear in this area.\n\nOur researchers have determined that the subspace energy near the abnormal waypoint is extremely unstable and cannot support the operation of a subspace channel. Therefore, our subspace engines cannot traverse this waypoint to reach the star system coordinates behind it. Given the current connection between $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ and subspace, perhaps we can ask $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ if they can assist us in crossing this waypoint."

This network was linked by energy collectors and storage facilities. No one knows the civilization that used it, no one has seen them, but to the $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$, they were very ancient. The only thing we know is that the star gods were masters of spatial control technology and time wormholes. They used their facilities to warp the rules of space-time, creating the Anoikis space, which exists between the warp and the real world.\n\nThe $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$, as vassals of the star gods, specialized in virtual reality, neural interfaces, and cryotechnology. They expanded their civilization to our star system through a wormhole in the 'No Return' star system and established the massive fortresses that now form the Void Exclusion Zone, along with giant observation stations. However, there were significant risks associated with spatial technology. The isolated Anoikis space could not be accepted by the will of the warp and the real world. The star gods' technology triggered severe wormhole and space-time collapse events. As time and space distorted, the star gods completely collapsed, and their colonies vanished. No one knows what exactly happened, but their traces in the star system were eventually hidden in the void of the 'Divine Border.'\n\nDuring this event, the $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$ packed their entire civilization into giant arks, drifting through the universe at slightly faster than light speeds to survive. Most of their species remained in a life-suspended virtual reality environment. This environment is called—Construct. From then on, they began to call themselves 'Indhuanni.'\n\nThe internal environment of the Construct used simulated time dilation, allowing their civilization to rapidly develop beyond what the physical world could imagine after surviving the crisis.

The life suspension technology created a conflict between self-awareness and the development of physical bodies, leading to consciousness erosion. To protect the safety of their consciousness and ensure they remained in the real world, the Indhuanni established a law early on called the 'One Mind, One Body Law.' Simply put, if someone had a consciousness in the Construct, they must have a corresponding body in reality. This had two purposes: first, to ensure that everything in the Construct was once their kin, but the Construct itself was eventually modified to use the brains of connected individuals as part of its computing system. Thus, if a physical body was removed, it would damage the Construct, and even take part of it away.\n\nThese syndromes were not truly diseases but genetic design flaws, causing all Indhuanni to eventually fall into depression, madness, and death after a sufficient amount of time. Eventually, the Indhuanni turned to those living in the Construct to find a cure for the disease. The only solution was to join the Construct and enter a state of life suspension. This period is known as the 'Isolation Days.' No one, not even the surviving Indhuanni, seems to fully understand what happened during those days."

However, as one empire declined, another rose.\n\nAt this time, the Indhuanni were in a state of turmoil. In the depths of Anoikis, some Indhuanni, tormented by genetic diseases to the point of madness, chose to fall into corruption. They subjected themselves to forbidden technologies, violating the One Mind, One Body Law. Over time, these mad Indhuanni became known as 'Name_Kuat_Contractor'.

They are harassing a powerful force in the Abyss Death Space, which seems to view the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ as the successor to the Second Indhuanni Empire, unaware that the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ are artificial creations.\n\nThis ancient war has now spread to the modern era. At this time, an unexpected event occurred for the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$. The stars in the Vela Domain are linked by the star gods of Anoikis, who built a Dyson swarm around the stars to achieve this and used this energy to create rifts in reality, allowing entities to traverse them.\n\nThe Caroline Star, due to the destruction of the isotope-5 storage facility, released an explosion of energy that surged through the linked network into the star, damaging the Dyson lattice around it. Years later, the star exploded, causing a larger explosion in the inner chambers of Anoikis. This event destroyed all the hyperspace routes and wormholes in Anoikis, trapping the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ within Anoikis. This event is known as the 'Caroline Star' event."
 kuat_extramonster.355.e:"§EReport Five: $Name_G_1$§!"
 kuat_extramonster.355.e.desc:"After the 'Caroline Star' event, possibly due to a chain reaction, the star in the 'No Return' region was captured by the gravitational pull of a black hole. It slowly orbits the black hole and gradually approaches it. Although it may take a very long time for the star to eventually sink into the black hole's singularity, the effects of the near-black hole orbit have already begun to manifest, with the singularity producing intense and unstable tidal forces.\n\nSince the star is located at the outer edge of the black hole's accretion disk, and the fluctuations in cloud mass density further exacerbate this instability, the star system environment in this region is extremely harsh. This may also be the reason why $Name_G_1$, after being silent for countless years, suddenly appeared before the world.\n\n§GAnd the Abyss Node located in $Name_G_1$, which was left behind from the abyss, can now be used to reconstruct Abyss technology. Now, we can use the Abyss Node to recover the lost technology of the Hibernators.§!"

 kuat_extramonster.38.a.resp: "$Name_Kuat_Contractor$' is an artificial life with self-awareness, and its consciousness comes from Azdaga, the ancient enemy of Inheduani. \n\nThe Stream of Vera is a belief of Inheduani. Vera is the realm where they live, and Azdaga, that is, '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$' has been trying to corrupt the Stream of Vera, so the ancient war with Inheduani broke out. With the demise of Inheduani, '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$' was imprisoned in the Realm of Vera by Inheduani's weapons, but they were also able to complete the integration of the Realm of Vera. For tens of thousands of years, '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$' is still looking for an opportunity to leave the Realm of Vera. However, due to the change of the main body that constitutes them, the new '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$' seems to have begun to pursue other meanings of existence. \n\nEven so, $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ cannot easily leave the Realm of Vera. In material reality, every $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will maintain the stability of the seal between the Abyss and the Realm of Vera. \n\nObviously, the return of $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ is an anomaly, and it is unknown why $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ has lost its function." #NT!

The ‘corrupted Narodia’ mentioned by ‘$Name_Kuat_Contractor$’ refers to those foreign races that choose to violate the taboos of the Valar. \n\nRegarding the galactic plague that has spread many times across the galaxy, perhaps it is the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ who are behind it. They use the plague to increase their kind through their understanding of genetic engineering. \n\nSince ‘$Name_Kuat_Contractor$’ now forms different races and factions according to the main body of its composition, the attitude towards Narodia will also change with the attitude of the faction.

 kuat_extramonster.38.b.resp: "The Vera Realm exists in Anoix, a very remote star region, and is the paradise of the Inheduani. It can only be reached through the Abyss. The star gate of the F star region was originally a wormhole leading to the Vera Realm. It was built into a star gate after being stabilized by artificial means. After the crisis of '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$', the galactic plague swept Anoix, destroying and integrating everything there. Even though it was assimilated by '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$', the Inheduani continued their eternal struggle with '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$'. The former paradise has been ravaged again and again, and now only a ruin remains. The Abyss is a space created by the Inheduani through their understanding of hyperspace mathematics and space manipulation. They use special "pipelines" to travel between the abysses, which seems to be similar to the technology of stabilizing hyperspace bubbles. The specific principles are still unclear. Their understanding of these theories is thousands of years ahead of us. Even now we cannot fully grasp the essence of these technologies." #NT!
  
 kuat_extramonster.38.d: "What is the military technology of ‘$Name_Kuat_Contractor$’?" #NT!
 kuat_extramonster.38.d.resp: "The military technology of '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$' is far beyond our imagination. The turrets of each of their combat ships are equipped with warp technology. The energy of the ship's warp core is guided into the warp accelerator through the isotope-5 matrix. The resulting eddy field output is entangled in the prism, and then radial particle groups are released from the core and released into this anti-polarity compression acceleration field. These subatomic particles collide violently in the accelerator, undergo critical heating and combine into a dense quark-gluon plasma superfluid pool, and then redirect outward through the prism effect to form a narrow, spiral luminous exotic matter light spear that pierces the target with extremely powerful force. And these turrets are all independently operated, floating on the hull through a special electromagnetic field. This design eliminates the resistance of the turret's rotation, allowing it to hit even the fastest targets flying around it, and rapid shooting is made possible through cryogenic and thermal management technology. This may be the most efficient starship weapon design we know. \n\nSimilar technology is also widely used in other modules of ships, which explains why even our most advanced ships cannot achieve a good combat loss ratio when they have a clear advantage in numbers. It is simply bullying to compete with such technological monsters. Now that we have mastered the relevant technology, maybe we can try their ships." #NT!
