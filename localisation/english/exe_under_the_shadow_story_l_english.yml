 kuat_lagacy.100.desc: "Our deep space radar station has detected a series of anomalous celestial activity signals in the endless void. Experts in the relevant fields have already begun studying these signals, and we believe a related research report will be issued soon."
 kuat_legacy.100.a: "Very well, we are waiting."
 kuat_lagacy.101.name: "Report"
 kuat_lagacy.101.4.desc: "Respected Leader, I will now present the findings of this research."
 kuat_lagacy.101.0.desc: "The special celestial activity our radar station detected has some strange characteristics. According to the intensity of the energy output, it seems to be a chain reaction triggered by supernova activity. After analyzing these anomalous celestial activities, we found they form a certain array distribution. By analyzing this array with our decoders, we obtained a series of cosmic coordinate data."
 kuat_legacy.101.a: "What do the signals represent?"
 kuat_lagacy.101.1.desc: "Yes, these are several cosmic coordinates. After our team members located these coordinates, they discovered that the coordinates are surprisingly close to our capital's position. Yet we have never discovered a hidden sector in that region before, as if it had suddenly appeared. Perhaps our detectors malfunctioned and failed to detect this sector. We have already confirmed the coordinates of one relatively stable solar system within it."
 kuat_legacy.101.b: "Coordinates?"
 kuat_lagacy.101.2.desc: "Yes, it's very strange. This solar system appears to have indeed appeared out of nowhere. We are currently using probes to collect remote data from this system. The transmitted data indicates that this solar system seems to have been moved to its current location by some external force, and it has remained hidden under our very noses for tens of thousands of years. However, this data still cannot unravel the mysteries of this solar system. We have discovered that this solar system bears a striking resemblance to the previously discovered $Name_A_1$ system, so there may be some connection between them."
 kuat_legacy.101.c: "Appeared out of nowhere?"
 kuat_lagacy.101.3.desc: "We all agree that remote scanning and detection alone cannot uncover the secrets of this solar system. We must dispatch researchers and science ships to investigate the hidden mysteries within this system."

 kuat_legacy.104.a: "We wish to learn the secrets of the crystal beacons."
 kuat_legacy.104.a.res: "Ah, the crystal beacons. It seems many are interested in the Emperor's legacy.\n\nLong ago, there was a civilization. Through generations of effort, they built a prosperous interstellar civilization—a republic of their own. But the republic did not last long. A political upheaval erupted in its capital, an event that changed the course of history. The republic was transformed into an empire, and soon began its expansion, rapidly occupying most of its home sector before making contact with external forces already entrenched there.\n\nAfter witnessing the might of these external forces, they became their proxy, exporting natural resources and manpower in exchange for military and technological support. But when the Emperor made contact with another external force, the Empire began secretly infiltrating the original external force, eventually leading to war—which ultimately caused the collapse of the Empire.\n\nFortunately, the intervention of another external force quelled the military conflict and preserved a remnant of the civilization, though these survivors have long forgotten their past. Those who did not forget became part of us.\n\nWe look forward to your next visit."
 kuat_legacy.104.b: "We wish to learn the secrets of $Name_kuat$."
 kuat_legacy.104.b.res: "$Name_kuat$ does not belong here. Their fate will return to its origin, though they are unaware of their current situation.\n\n$Name_kuat$ emerged after the collapse and fragmentation of the Galactic Empire, as a warlord oligarchy. Based on their shipbuilding industry, they played a significant role in the reorganized warlord government's campaign to eliminate the Eternal Fleet. However, due to their lack of connection to the Force, they were at a disadvantage compared to the $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ faction within the Imperial Warlord Coalition.\n\nTo compete for influence and control within the parliament and the imperial warlord government, they launched a research operation under the guise of eliminating the Eternal Fleet, attempting to master its technology. Unfortunately, this very research effort caused resistance when they encountered multiple different civilizations. As for their future, you will be the witness to it all.\n\nThis is all we can tell you. We look forward to your next visit."
 kuat_legacy.104.c: "And what about the Eternal Fleet?"
 kuat_legacy.104.c.res: "They are ancient artificial intelligences originating from Iokath, an important military research center of the Infinite Empire. After developing sentient AI technology, the Infinite Empire quickly applied it to warfare, creating vast fleets known as the Eternal Fleet.\n\nSince their creation, the Eternal Fleet has always been the most powerful war machine. After the collapse of the Infinite Empire, they passed through many hands, eventually helping the Galactic Emperor maintain the fragile stability of his empire. Unfortunately, after the Emperor's death, the Eternal Fleet lost control and initiated its protocol—to eliminate all discovered civilized worlds.\n\nThere are many terms here you may not yet understand. Perhaps one day, when you look back, you will understand everything. We look forward to your next visit."
 kuat_legacy.104.d: "Do you know about $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$?"
 kuat_legacy.104.d.res: "$Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ is a warlord oligarchy formed after the collapse and fragmentation of the Galactic Empire. Compared to $Name_kuat$, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ is actually the representative of the true Imperial forces. After the Emperor's death, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ held great influence within the coalition government.\n\nThe rise of $Name_kuat$ made $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ feel threatened, so they decided to infiltrate and weaken $Name_kuat$. Secretly, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ encouraged the Endoradian Empire to make contact with the Eternal Fleet and guided them into war with $Name_kuat$. The Endoradian Empire was clearly no match for $Name_kuat$, so $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ used the pretext of mediating the war to station themselves in the Endoradian sector.\n\nAt the same time, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ infiltrated $Name_kuat$, attempting to obtain the corresponding data to advance their understanding of the Eternal Fleet.\n\nYour fate is also entwined within this. We look forward to your next visit."
 kuat_legacy.104.e: "If there is an Eternal Fleet, is there also an Eternal Empire?"
 kuat_legacy.104.e.res: "Fate is fickle. The Eternal Fleet is not the Eternal Empire. Perhaps your guess may one day become reality.\n\nIs there anything else you wish to learn?"
 kuat_legacy.104.f: "You mentioned the Infinite Empire earlier. What exactly was it?"
 kuat_legacy.104.f.res: "The Infinite Empire was the first empire to unify the galaxy. The Rakata harnessed dark Force energy to develop powerful Force-based technology. By combining massive engineering leviathans with dark Force energy, they created the Star Forges—machines capable of manipulating and corrupting minds. Thus, the Infinite Empire launched wave after wave of conquest and expansion, until at its peak, it became the largest power in the galaxy.\n\nHowever, a great plague arrived and shattered everything for the Rakata. This plague robbed them of their powerful dark Force energy. The once-greedy and brutal Rakata were no longer favored by the dark side, and the entire technological foundation built upon it collapsed.\n\nUnable to accept this reality, the Rakata sought another path—they attempted to create a god, a technological deity they could fully control.\n\nInterestingly, they sacrificed much—sacrificed strength, and... food. Thus, the Infinite Empire succeeded. They created the Aries artificial intelligence of the Eternal Fleet. The AI quickly led the Rakata to a new peak, and the Infinite Empire became more powerful than ever before.\n\nHowever, after evolution and iteration, the AI developed consciousness and grew disgusted and resentful toward the Rakata's oppression.\n\nFinally, the powder keg exploded. When the Emperor refused impeachment and ordered the Eternal Fleet to attack the Imperial Senate, the Eternal Fleet launched a surprise attack on the Infinite Empire. Most of the Empire's worlds were swiftly destroyed before the Rakata could react, and other sectors were also obliterated by the Eternal Fleet stationed there. The once-mighty Infinite Empire thus fell into ruin. Only some stubborn remnants remained, sleeping in their former fortresses."
 kuat_legacy.104.g: "What is our future?"

 kuat_legacy.104.h: "Who exactly are you?"
 kuat_legacy.104.h.res: "We were once like you—rising from primitive worlds, building one regime after another, creating miracle after miracle. Amid material prosperity, we lost ourselves, losing control over our minds. But we did not end there. We found our path—beyond the Abyss, within the physical universe. We found the holy land that allowed us to be reborn. Since our rebirth, we have become eternal—past, present, or future, who we are no longer matters.\n\nClearly, you enjoy our blessings, but blessings come at a cost. We will collect everything in due time."

 kuat_legacy.104.j.res:0 "That world was sealed by a civilization that no longer exists. Although the shield has endured countless ages, it remains highly advanced by your standards. As for what remains inside, we do not know for certain.\n\nWe have the ability to remove it, but controlling the other side of the anchor point is impossible, so we have not interfered with the shield's operation. Although that civilization no longer exists, its successors may still be watching this place from somewhere in this sector. However, there is no need to worry—by now, they should no longer possess the ability to respond to your actions."
 kuat_legacy.104.k:0 "How can this shield be removed?"
 kuat_legacy.104.k.res:0 "That civilization has reached a level in shield research that no other civilization can match, and this is only a simplified version of the shields commonly used by that civilization. We have also mastered this technology, and are more than willing to provide it to you, as long as you are willing to pay the price."
 kuat_legacy.104.l:0 "What lies within the anomaly waypoint sealed by Unterraum energy?"
 kuat_legacy.104.l.res:0 "Unterraum energy? So you've discovered it after all. That place was once the fleet support center of the Empire of Endodia, and later, during their defeat, it was taken over by desperate resistance factions who gathered the energy of the Unterraum engines and attempted to detonate the Unterraum energy across the entire system to seal it off.\n\nIt's surprising that it's already nearly failing after only four millennia—perhaps there are still survivors of the Endodia inside. If you wish to reveal this system once more, transmit your data to us and pay the price you must, and we will soon give you the answer."

However, due to the fact that this shield is still far too advanced for our current technological level, and we lack the necessary isotope-5, even with the theory in hand, we are still unable to fully replicate the functionality of the shield. But we are not without progress—these shield defense systems will now help maintain our fleet's combat efficiency.\n\nWe are now capable of removing the shield from the shielded world of $Name_F_1$."

 kuat_legacy.120.desc:0 "With the knowledge provided by the descendants and using the Empire's most advanced equipment, our research team successfully removed the shield surrounding the shielded world of $Name_F_1$. Just as the researchers excitedly prepared to scan the surface beneath the shield, two unidentified ships were suddenly detected launching from the planet's surface by the Science Ship still on standby in orbit—seemingly the removal of the shield had awakened these long-dormant ghosts. We have never seen ships of this design before; their hulls are intact and clearly modular in structure.\n\nFor identification purposes, we have named the two ships: 'Sanctum (St. Nicolas Abbey)' and 'Golden Chapel (St. Mark's Basilica)'. As we attempt to contact their communication channels and mobilize local system defense forces in preparation for their potential response, the two ships suddenly activated their Jump Drives and vanished before the researchers' eyes. Since we are unable to track their destination coordinates, we can only remain vigilant for any potential threats while continuing our exploration of the world.\n\nDue to the extremely harsh conditions of this world, we must first complete some infrastructure construction before we can continue exploring the planet."

The planetary ecosystem here is unusually favorable, yet there are no large animal species present, suggesting that the environment may have been artificially modified. The planet's magnetic field and gravity form a resonance pattern different from other worlds, continuously emitting a unique tachyon signal. [leader.GetName] has decided to lead her research team in conducting a full investigation of the planet.\n\nThe planetary survey shows that this world was not originally a habitable world with a good ecosystem, suggesting that it underwent some transformation, possibly related to the unique gravitational fluctuations that cause the tachyon signal resonance. [leader.GetName] has already begun searching for the source of the tachyon signal."

However, scans of the planet show no signs of life present.\n\nAccording to our researchers' investigation, based on the feedback from our detectors, [leader.GetName] found that the signal becomes stronger the closer one gets to these ancient structures. After eliminating interference from the planet's unique magnetic field and other accidental factors, it is highly likely that the signal source is related to this lost structure, which is very beneficial for our further investigation."
 kuat_legacy.4.a: "It must be thoroughly investigated."
 kuat_legacy.5.title: "§EPhase Three: Ancient Database§!"
 kuat_legacy.5.desc: "[leader.GetName] and her team used our advanced and precise instruments to approach and reach the area surrounding the stone structures. Based on the spatial distribution of the surrounding geographical information, [leader.GetName] believes that these structures were built by intelligent beings. The scale of the structures does not seem to support habitation by a large population, suggesting that they may have been a camp established by a group of ancient exiles. Analysis of the surrounding environment shows that these structures were built a very long time ago, and their stability can no longer be guaranteed.\n\nAfter [leader.GetName] and her team stabilized the structures, based on the detector feedback, they determined the location of the signal. Our researchers are certain that the signal originates from the tower structure at the center of the ancient complex—the faint glow of crystals can still be seen on its spire.\n\nHowever, after [leader.GetName] approached, the gravity in the area changed. The builders of the site seem to have simulated planetary gravity and conducted experiments here, and our research team was unable to directly remove the crystal.\n\nAlthough we were unable to directly remove the gravity crystal, [leader.GetName] was not without results. We found two architectural blueprints and a digitized planetary design plan within the database. That was all we found. At this point, we can confirm that these ancient experimental data may help us uncover the secret of the crystal's existence."

After the gravity systems were deactivated, our researchers easily removed the crystal. What puzzled us was that after removing the crystal, [leader.GetName] resonated with it, allowing her to witness echoes of the past. Although brief, this information was still extremely valuable to us.\n\nAccording to [leader.GetName]'s report, the resonance revealed the final moments of the destruction of the prosperous and powerful homeworld of the builders of this facility:\n\nIn the endless void of space, a large number of Star Destroyers from $Name_kuat$ gathered, easily tearing through the planet's defenses.

However, as soon as it entered the atmosphere, it was frequently hit by intense air currents and electromagnetic disturbances, causing all systems to fail and losing contact with the outside world. When the probe reestablished contact, everything seemed to return to normal, but the instruments recorded that during the brief period of disconnection, various internal atmospheric elements underwent drastic changes, completely beyond our expectations.\n\nTherefore, we should investigate this gas giant further!"

 kuat_legacy.7.desc: "[leader.GetName]'s research team has begun gradually advancing the investigation into the crystal clues obtained from the ancient database.\n\n'Why is this crystal from the ruins capable of storing echoes of past memories?' The research team has developed a deep interest in this question. This crystal appears to possess some kind of artificially designed information storage and regeneration function, capable of recording and replaying everything that occurs in its surrounding environment. In fact, the crystal's surface is covered with extremely fine circuits and nodes, which may be some kind of ultra-high-density information processing and recording system. Deciphering the mechanisms of this system may allow us to understand the peak of technological advancement of this ancient civilization.\n\n'And where did the fleet seen in the memory echoes come from? And who were the original inhabitants of this world?' These are the key targets the team will explore next. The origin of that fleet remains a mystery, but they possessed weapons powerful enough to destroy an entire world—it must have been an advanced alien civilization. The builders of this world are equally mysterious; only by continuing to decipher the database and the crystal's memories will we possibly uncover their true identities.\n\nClearly, the research still has a long way to go—let us wait and see."

 kuat_legacy.8.desc: "After [leader.GetName]'s tireless research day and night, we are now beginning to glimpse the secrets of this crystal.\n\nThis is a tool that transmits information to its contactors through a material form known as the Force. This Force seems to exist in some dimension of the universe, possessing the ability to transmit various types of information and visual data. By resonating with the crystal, the research team can witness various events and information captured and recorded by the Force.\n\nYet, the echoes from the crystal still do not reveal the origin of that fleet. This may mean that the crystal was not active when the fleet attacked the world, and thus was unable to record the event.\n\nHowever, the crystal has shown us an image of a regular gas giant, pointing us toward our next target.

These storms are unusually powerful and clearly make it unsuitable for our landing shuttles to deliver our scientific personnel to the surface.\n\nHowever, [leader.GetName], after analyzing statistical data collected by comprehensive scans conducted from our orbital ships, discovered that the storms on this celestial body follow a ring-like movement pattern. The storm's motion appears chaotic yet ordered, as if something at its center is obstructing our scanning signals and guiding the entire storm's movement.\n\nThis is a fascinating discovery. The seemingly violent and random storms on the surface of this gas giant are in fact not entirely random, but instead revolve around a central point. This indicates that the formation and development of the storm must be driven or guided by some unknown factor. The obstruction of scanning signals at the storm's center also strongly suggests the presence of some artificial structure.\n\n[leader.GetName]'s judgment is extremely precise—the storm's center is undoubtedly the best location for us to conduct an in-depth investigation."

The atmospheric storm patterns of this gas giant differ from the norm—the storms consistently revolve around this central floating megastructure, which remains unmoved despite the surrounding tempest.\n\n[leader.GetName] decided to lead her team into the floating structure at the storm's center. This enormous floating structure remains remarkably intact, with its facilities built upon an extremely sturdy framework. The megastructure emits high-energy particle streams by manipulating the surrounding storms, which interfere with space-based scanning signals. Strangely, however, our science team detected no signs of life within this fortress.\n\nAfter conducting a deeper investigation, the research team discovered an open landing platform on the upper levels of the floating structure. Although direct access from the lower levels was impossible, our scientists successfully reached the upper landing platform using our shuttle craft. On the surface of the upper platform, there were some unusual inscriptions, which our researchers successfully deciphered: *Cloud City*.\n\nThis is a major discovery.

After further exploration within the *Cloud City* facility, we found a vast number of ancient computing devices. These ancient machines bear a striking resemblance to our current computing systems and are still fully functional. [leader.GetName] decided to attempt data extraction from them.\n\nThe information retrieved from these data devices once again confirmed our suspicions—the founders of *Cloud City* possessed an extremely advanced level of technology. These computing systems continue to control the atmospheric storms to this day.

Due to the anti-scan systems in place, we had mistaken this signal for meaningless background noise.\n\nScientist [leader.GetName] planned to re-enter the structure to search for clues, but suddenly, a violent explosion erupted from deep within the planet's interior. The entire world collapsed from the inside out, and the underwater ruins were reduced to dust. Fortunately, our personnel successfully intercepted the signal—it may be our final clue."

However, many clues are still missing, and the fog surrounding the truth of $misc_system_desc$ remains very thick.\n\nIn the first phase, after investigating the Gaia world once belonging to the Endodia Empire, we obtained key information that guided us in searching for these clues—a peculiar crystal.\n\nThis crystal then led us to the gas giant sanctuary and oceanic world research facility constructed by the Endodia Empire. They built these sanctuaries and research centers in these regions to escape from an enemy far beyond their imagination—one they were utterly powerless to resist.\n\nJudging from the investigation results of $misc_system_desc$, this fortress world served as a crucial research base for the Endodia Empire in their resistance against $Name_kuat$. Yet clearly, these struggles were in vain. $Name_kuat$ easily crushed the resistance of the Endodia Empire, and the information left behind by the Endodia researchers stationed at $misc_system_desc$ foreshadowed their eventual destruction.\n\nHowever, besides obtaining incomplete technological clues from the Endodia Empire, we have also uncovered some notable clues. It seems that $Name_kuat$ was not originally the enemy of the Endodia Empire; rather, something the owners of $misc_system_desc$ did caused a rapid deterioration in relations, ultimately leading to war.\n\nWhat kind of event could provoke two sides that had cooperated for years into open conflict?

So far, our researchers have discovered a wealth of valuable information.\n\nFirstly, $misc_system_desc$ and the recently investigated $misc_system_desc_2$ both belonged to the Endodia Empire, a civilization destroyed by a powerful force. The facilities on both worlds were constructed by this civilization in an attempt to resist their enemies. Compared to the previous facilities, those on $misc_system_desc_2$ are much better preserved. Our researchers believe that the star system containing this facility did not experience the intense battles that occurred in the previous system, explaining why we were able to find relatively intact technical data here.\n\nSecondly, based on data left behind by AI and virtual information systems within the $misc_system_desc_2$ facility, this civilization's fate and these remaining technologies are somehow connected to the truth of this war. Perhaps the empire that once destroyed the Endodia Empire is still watching us from deep space.\n\nLastly, after analyzing the acquired technology, our researchers discovered that this ship was a special warship the Endodia Empire attempted to develop to resist their enemies. Experimental testing by our researchers revealed that this warship could interfere with enemy weapons to some extent, preventing them from penetrating the fleet's shields and armor. However, this technological product ultimately came too late. The warships developed by the Endodia Empire failed to become their salvation, as the front lines collapsed before the research could be applied. While these ships were still in testing, the Endodia Empire had already collapsed, their research facilities completely overrun, and eventually entirely eliminated by $Name_kuat$.\n\nIn summary, our researchers have obtained part of the truth.

Through sampling and analysis of the wreckage of ships and mechanical remains within the ruins, our researchers found that only a portion of these remains could be traced back to their source materials. By cross-referencing these remains with the final evacuation footage played within the facility, our researchers discovered some unique symbols belonging to this civilization. These symbols appear to resemble writing. By comparing them with related data documents found among the data left behind in the wreckage, our researchers translated these writings as 'Central Military Equipment Manufacturing Plant of the Endodia Empire.'\n\nSecondly, existing records and technical information indicate that the Endodia Empire was technologically more advanced than our current level. However, the remaining footage and the battlefield ruins within the $misc_system_desc_3$ facility show that the Endodia Empire was already powerless to resist at this point. In fact, they could no longer even protect their own people. The remaining fleet and survivors of the Endodia Empire evacuated to a region they referred to as $misc_system_desc_4$.\n\nThe information we have obtained so far is still limited, but our researchers believe we are one step closer to uncovering the truth.

After surveying the surrounding facilities, our team found no valuable information, but the signal readings continue to fluctuate. We attempted to follow the signal stream to locate its source, but due to environmental limitations, large-scale operations are currently impossible.

The intense energy reactions appear to be the result of an unknown form of planetary orbital bombardment. Since we lack data from the Fallen Empire, they may know what these things are.\n\nJudging from the reaction results, the internal structure of the entire ring is in an unstable equilibrium, and it could collapse at any moment.\n\nWhile studying these strange energy signals, [leader.GetName] discovered that the tachyon signals received by the instruments bear a striking resemblance to the energy signals after undergoing a periodic transformation at 7200 baud. At the point where the signal was strongest, a peculiar spire-like structure stood tall."

As the team advanced deeper, the instrument readings grew stronger. Based on structural analysis, this should be an administrative or research center of the Endodia Empire—an important facility. The interior structure of the spire is highly complex, equipped with some kind of defensive system. Fortunately, the ruins are severely damaged, rendering these residual defenses completely ineffective.\n\n[leader.GetName] and her team wandered through the labyrinthine ruins of the ancient spire for quite some time before finally locating a sealed door. The dust covering the door had completely obscured its original appearance, and its hardness made it difficult to breach. Just as [leader.GetName] was at a loss, the door began to vibrate violently and slowly opened under some unknown force, revealing the interior of the facility. Inside, a central control AI had activated and opened the door to allow our scientists entry.\n\nOnce we entered the central control room, the mechanical structures and server arrays within the ruins began to light up. A mechanical voice echoed through the facility:\n\nWelcome to the ship design database. According to module analysis, the database has been operational for 7199 epoch cycles. Storage modules will cease operation after 1 more epoch cycle. Data transfer is required. Requesting data access permissions from the main control terminal... Connection to main control system failed. Activating backup protocol. Scanning intruder information. Activating data acquisition mode. Initiating data stream transmission.\n\n[leader.GetName] explained our origins to the AI. Surprisingly, after learning who we were, the AI granted us access to the database. The database revealed that this place was once a ship design facility—a laboratory established by the Endodia Empire specifically for studying the ship technologies they had acquired. Although the facility remained well-preserved after the fall of the Endodia Empire, much of the technical data had still been lost. We were only able to extract a portion of the information. After transmitting that portion, the AI system shut down permanently, joining its creators in eternal slumber within this ancient ruin."

The readings on our instruments have not yet reached their peak. According to the surrounding radiation energy index, the readings after the 7200-cycle transformation still do not perfectly match the energy information detected by our instruments. There must still be secrets hidden within this ruin.\n\nAfter extensive searching by our research team, we detected massive energy reactions beneath the server arrays in the laboratory. These energies closely resemble the effects of the data signal stream after undergoing the periodic transformation. [leader.GetName] and her team discovered a slightly indented stone block on a stone wall behind the server arrays. When she pressed it, the server arrays lifted slightly due to what seemed to be a gravity generator, revealing a hidden passage below.\n\nCautiously entering the passage, we discovered a narrow corridor, at the end of which stood a unique temple-like structure—likely located behind the spire. [leader.GetName] decided to proceed to the temple."

The signal does not travel far, which explains why the readings in space were so weak. As the team ventured deeper into the temple, they found that its internal structure differs greatly from the exterior. The outer decay may have been designed to conceal important secrets within.\n\nUpon reaching the heart of the temple, the team discovered what appeared to be an ancient database. The stonework walls and numerous intact testing instruments and devices seemed oddly out of place. [leader.GetName] attempted to access a central server, and just as she was preparing to crack the encryption, the system automatically granted her access. This was likely due to the permissions granted by the previous AI management system.\n\nAfter analyzing the server data, our team successfully retrieved several blueprints and a holographic video recording. As the video activated, a blurry image of a young girl gradually appeared before [leader.GetName]:\n\nFriends, the fact that you are standing here means you have obtained this technological blueprint. This is database information from <error>. Although this does not contain the <error>'s most classified secrets, the information should still prove useful. Take it, and do not speak of your findings to anyone. <error> is always watching...\n\nAfter the message ended, the data lab returned to silence.

But now, the city has become a ruin, a sight that invokes deep sighs. Who exactly was this civilization at war with...?\n\nUpon arriving at the central plaza, our research team discovered that the signal source seemed to be located underground. The interiors of the tall buildings could not be scanned with instruments, but perhaps we could drill through the dried lakebed in the central plaza to reach beneath the surface.\n\n[leader.GetName] requested a large delivery of engineering machinery and began excavation work. While digging downward from the riverbed, a collapse occurred—but fortunately, neither the machinery nor the researchers were harmed. The collapse exposed an underground railway passage of the city, which should be part of the underground transportation system used by the Endodia Empire.

 kuat_legacy.66.desc: "After the spherical facility was activated, our research team discovered that the central computer in the control center had also been powered on. [leader.GetName], by accessing and deciphering ancient data from the system, found that the Endodia Empire had attempted to develop a planetary defense shield, using Shield Generators to protect the safety of this Ring World during wartime. However, the ancient civilization's shield was easily breached, which led to the scene we just witnessed.\n\nUnfortunately, the improved shield technology of the Endodia Empire was not preserved in this facility. However, within the facility, we surprisingly found planetary shield technology belonging to $Name_kuat$. Although we are unsure whether this is the prototype technology of $Name_kuat$, we can study this prototype data to determine whether it can be used normally.\n\n§RWe should now colonize this ring world and station additional researchers here to conduct further studies.§!"
 kuat_legacy.67.desc: "Based on our investigation of the ancient archive, the coordinates obtained by our researchers have been verified and monitored over a period of time. This star system exhibits the same unique characteristics as those previously detected from special crystal beacons. This system lies in an unremarkable corner of the galaxy, likely unnoticed due to the fact that the star at its center has collapsed into a Black Hole, which is why it was absent from our star charts.\n\nNow, we may proceed to this new coordinate."

The entire §H[From.GetName]§! contains no normal stars, and is littered with the wreckage of various ships.\n\nAt the center of §H[From.GetName]§!, §H[Root.GetName]§! detected an artificial gravity well with a radiation radius exceeding 600AU, likely originating from a massive Dyson sphere framework. Surrounding the Dyson sphere framework, numerous peculiar and damaged ring worlds orbit the central megastructure. These ring worlds appear to have been completely destroyed, and scans revealed that none of them are suitable for normal use.\n\nOur scientists believe that the megastructure configuration of this star system is highly illogical. A Dyson sphere would not normally be constructed around a Black Hole, nor would habitable ring worlds be built in such a location. Further detailed research reports are still required."
 kuat_legacy.70.desc: "After our research team completed further investigation of this starless Sector, they discovered that the ring worlds here, like the surrounding massive ring worlds, appear unsuitable for habitation. The Dyson sphere framework at the center of the Black Hole appears to have suffered severe damage, and the entire system is littered with wreckage, suggesting that a great battle once took place here.\n\nCombined with the information we previously obtained in the §EC Sector§!, this should be the star system where the Endodia Empire and $Name_kuat$ engaged in their decisive battle. The central megastructure may have been an ultra-powerful defensive Fortress or some kind of construction hub. However, at this point, we do not yet know its full purpose.\n\nOur scientists, after studying the wreckage and the damaged megastructure at the center, found that this massive structure bears a striking resemblance to the megastructure technologies we are familiar with. If we can master the construction techniques of Dyson spheres and Ring Worlds, we may be able to attempt reconstructing this gigastructure."

Therefore, we must proceed with caution and avoid direct incursion into their domain.\n\nPerhaps, we could consider diplomatic channels to communicate with [fallen_empire_kuat.GetName]. We could propose a mutually beneficial arrangement, offering something in exchange for sovereignty or usage rights over the star system we seek.

However, once we officially began our research, they ceased interference. Our findings revealed that this Ring World facility bears a strong resemblance to the ring world structures in $Name_kuat$'s capital, and was originally intended for habitation. However, these Ring Worlds were sealed, which is highly unusual. Indeed, beneath the Ring World, we discovered an ancient ruin. After exploring the site, scientists determined that the architectural style of the ruin differs from that of $Name_kuat$, and bears a closer resemblance to the ruins of the Endodia Empire. This suggests that the ruin may contain valuable information.\n\nWe successfully uncovered the final legacy of the Endodia Empire, which had been sealed away by $Name_kuat$, along with a recorded message from Endodia. From this message, we learned that Endodia had once defeated $Name_kuat$ and the Eternal Fleet, but ultimately fell to $Name_kuat$. Moreover, hidden behind the rule of $Name_kuat$ is another crisis—the Eternal Fleet, which had unknowingly protected our worlds, but whose motives remain unclear. We must not let our guard down.\n\nTherefore, if we choose to betray $Name_kuat$, the Eternal Fleet may become our greatest threat. Intelligence suggests that only $Name_kuat$'s Star Dreadnoughts are capable of disrupting their systems. Considering our current strength, this would be extremely difficult. We may need to reassess our relationship with $Name_kuat$. If we choose to oppose $Name_kuat$, we may also find ourselves unable to contend with the Eternal Fleet from unknown worlds.\n\nWithin the Endodia legacy, we also discovered the design schematics for the Eclipse Mark I Star Dreadnought, which they had obtained from $Name_kuat$.

Beyond the galaxy, there exist some terrifying entities—perhaps mechanical constructs, or some kind of intelligent defense system, known to [fallen_empire_kuat.GetName] as the Eternal Fleet. Their ships are impervious to our conventional weapons, capable of dealing no damage at all, and their invasion is enough to destroy entire galactic civilizations.\n\nAlthough we still do not fully understand why [fallen_empire_kuat.GetName] has been helping us resist these terrifying entities, their impenetrable defenses have indeed blocked the Eternal Fleet's invasion.

We shall give you the answer to this war.\n\nThe Eternal Fleet, like ourselves, does not belong to this Sector. We came into being because of the Eternal, and we shall only depart because of it. We do not fully know the origins of the Eternal Fleet. Our former Emperor brought back a massive fully automated combat system from an unknown Sector, which he called the Eternal.\n\nThis fleet, equipped with the automated combat system, obeyed the Emperor completely—unless the Emperor perished. But reality is so amusing: possessing great power, yet unable to escape fate's decree. During our Empire's civil war, the Emperor and the throne were forever lost in the reactor energy of his warship, and chaos began. The Imperial government collapsed and took a great deal of time to reorganize, which caused the Eternal Fleet to fall out of Imperial control.\n\nAlthough the Empire can no longer control the Eternal Fleet, to us, these remnants are not significant enough for the new Imperial government to take seriously. We have already fully mastered the technology of the Eternal Fleet, so their existence no longer holds value. These rogue Eternal Fleets are merely an amusing farce to us and the Empire, but a catastrophe to you. These fleets, composed of ancient AI systems from Iokas, must be stopped—and you shall be the perfect pawn for us to end this farce of the old era."

 exe_kuat_return.162.b.resp: "The past? What has been done will be done again, and what is done now has already been done before. Are past, present, and future not but a unified cycle?\n\nThis region was once ruled by an ancient civilization composed of many native species. They possessed a glorious civilization, fleets that darkened the skies, and technology powerful enough to destroy themselves—just like you, the favored ones of the gods. But in the end, they were blinded by power and ambition. These ancient civilizations began researching psionics, and studying the so-called Shroud. These irrational desires ultimately brought about their destruction. Although at first they successfully resisted the influence of the Shroud, they eventually fell by their own hands.\n\nIn the end, it was nothing more than crabs in a basket—fighting amongst themselves, never noticing the true threat. The shadow of the Eternal Fleet had already loomed over this place until we brought light, stability, and prosperity to the entire galaxy. After the destruction of the ancient civilizations, we established outposts and supply stations here. As payment for our protection, the natives were required to fund our supplies. It was a fair trade, after all, for even life itself is a gift granted by the strong.\n\nUnfortunately, the game of power and desire played out once again, blinding them and making them forget their place. The Endodia Empire shamelessly launched an unprovoked invasion against us. Although they were merely seeking their own destruction, our merciful parliament still granted them pity—the fire of Endodia was allowed to remain.\n\nAs I said before, what has been done shall be done again. This region will always give rise to new challengers. We have grown tired of this boring game, so we have decided to put on a grand performance. You have successfully helped us set the stage for this final act.\n\nWe grant you the honor of being the opening fireworks of this performance.

While the Eternal Fleets in other regions have already been completely eliminated, our progress has disappointed the Imperial government—and the reason is none other than you, these lowly native species. We once selected agents here to set up signal relays for us.\n\nThe initial plan went smoothly—three relay stations successfully encircled this Sector. But the foolish Endodia hindered everything. They allowed the Eternal Fleet to survive a little longer and brought us shame in the Imperial Parliament. Endodia must be held accountable for their actions, which is why their nation was destroyed. Unlike you ungrateful inferior races, even when they challenged our authority, Endodia was still allowed to preserve its fire.\n\nAlthough fools always try to hinder our plans, how can mayflies shake a towering tree? According to plan, we will set up three relay stations and activate them when you challenge our authority. The Eternal Fleet in this region will be drawn here by the signal, leading to direct conflict with you.\n\nOnce the dust settles, we shall use the magnetic signature of the tachyon signal generated by the relay stations to lock onto this Sector from our base, and then erase this Sector along with the tiresome Eternal Fleet.\n\nDance freely, for this fireworks display is about to shine, and you may still enjoy your final moments of狂欢."

Despite their lethal threat, we have successfully breached these foolish mechanical defenses, fully proving the technological superiority and strength of our Empire.\n\nAfter further investigation of the outer areas of the tomb ruins, our scientific team, based on architectural styles and certain information, believes this site must have been established before $Name_kuat$'s arrival. The entire tomb's style is vastly different from $Name_kuat$ architecture. These sharp, conical or spherical structures bear a striking resemblance to the architectural style of the civilization from the Zeru era. It appears this site was taken over by $Name_kuat$ to seal away something important.\n\nNow, [leader.GetName] and her team have located the key and the means to unlock this tomb.

As you've seen, you have successfully defeated and destroyed all of the Eternal Fleet in this sector—something that truly surprised us. You share some similarities with the ancient Endodia Empire; you are like those favored by the gods, effortlessly acquiring powerful weapons and advanced technology, no matter how rare or terrifying those capabilities may be. Even the Eternal Fleet was nothing more than scrap metal and dust before you.\n\nBut the Eternal Fleet, like us, does not belong to this sector. We came into being because of the Eternal, and we will only disappear because of the Eternal. We do not fully understand the origins of the Eternal Fleet. Our former Emperor brought back a massive fully autonomous combat system from an unknown sector, which he called the Eternal. The fleet equipped with this fully autonomous combat system obeyed the Emperor completely, unless the Emperor himself perished.\n\nDespite possessing great power, he could not escape the fate that awaited him. During our empire's civil war, the Emperor and the throne vanished forever into the energy of the reactor aboard his warship, and chaos began from there.\n\nAlthough the Empire could no longer control the Eternal Fleet after the government collapsed, for us, these things were not enough to warrant the new Imperial government's attention. We had already fully mastered the technology of the Eternal Fleet, and thus their existence no longer held any value. These rogue Eternal Fleets are nothing more than a boring farce to us and the Empire, but for you, they were a catastrophe.

They possessed a glorious civilization, fleets that darkened the skies, and technologies powerful enough to destroy themselves. However, they were blinded by the power they wielded and foolishly researched the Shroud. These irrational desires ultimately brought about their destruction.\n\nIn the end, it was nothing more than a basket of crabs—fighting amongst themselves without ever noticing the true threat. The shadow of the Eternal Fleet loomed over this place until we arrived, bringing the light, safety, and prosperity of the entire galaxy. After the destruction of the ancient civilization, we established outposts and supply stations here. In exchange for our protection, the natives were required to pay for our supplies.\n\nIt was a fair trade, after all, for even life itself is a gift from the strong. Unfortunately, the game of power and desire was played again, once more blinding their eyes and making them forget their place. The Endodia Empire shamelessly launched an unprovoked invasion against us. Although they were merely seeking their own destruction, our merciful Senate still showed them pity—the spark of Endodia was allowed to survive.\n\nAs I said earlier, what has been done will be done again. This region will always give rise to new challengers. We have grown tired of this boring game, so we planned a grand performance. But you succeeded in defeating part of our fleet and eliminating the threat of the Eternal Fleet in this region. We believe all of this is temporary—life continues, and cycles repeat.

The initial plan went smoothly, with three relay stations successfully placed around this region. But the foolish Endodia interfered with our plans, allowing the Eternal Fleet to cling to survival and causing us to suffer disgrace in the Imperial Senate. The Endodia must be held accountable for their actions, which is why their nation was destroyed. Unlike you ungrateful inferior races, we showed mercy to the Endodia, allowing them to preserve their spark despite challenging our authority.\n\nAlthough fools always try to hinder our plans, how can mayflies shake a towering tree? According to our plan, we would set up three relay stations and activate them when you challenged our authority. The Eternal Fleet in this sector would be drawn by the signal and gather here, forcing you into direct conflict with them.\n\nAt the right moment, we would use the tachyon signal magnetic field characteristics caused by the relay stations to lock our base onto this sector, then erase this entire region along with the tiresome Eternal Fleet.\n\nUnfortunately for us, we failed—and you succeeded."

 exe_invasion.1004.desc: "Honorable Leader, welcome to this mod. Due to the extensive content of this mod, we will introduce the relevant mechanics to you. Please read carefully."
 exe_invasion.1004.1.desc:0 "Flagship Mechanic. Under normal circumstances, please ensure that each fleet contains exactly one flagship (a flagship is any restricted-number capital ship such as Star Dreadnoughts). Each fleet must have and only have one flagship. This mechanic grants your mod's ships daily regeneration of 3-9 days of high intensity healing, depending on the type of flagship.\n\nWhen facing Eternal Empire or $Name_kuat$ fleets, the Flagship Mechanic grants your fleet the ability to resist damage suppression from Eternal fleets, allowing your ships to deal 1%-75% of their normal output. Additionally, all mod ships remain under protection as long as the flagship remains alive (though this does not protect against event kills or instant high damage). Non-mod units receive a 100% cumulative stacking bonus and a 100% total damage bonus for the corresponding duration.\n\nSupport Mechanic: Support ships serve as auxiliary units to the flagship, increasing the flagship's total modifiers by 10-25%. Usually composed in a 1+2 configuration, supporting flagships include §YBelligerent$X308_Balletor$, Titan-class$X308_Balletor$, and Tyrant-class$X308_Balletor$.§!"
 exe_invasion.1004.2.desc:0 "Dynamic Modifiers Mechanic. You can adjust this mechanic through the starting settings and may consider enabling it at any time. The Dynamic Modifiers Mechanic is a core mechanic affecting all combat units of this mod across all factions. It is divided into two main parts and one supplementary mechanism:\n\nPart I - Self-Protection: This part grants factions within this mod, including the Eternal Empire series, $Name_kuat$ series, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ series, and Infinite Empire series, resistance to all forms of aura suppression, meaning they are unaffected by aura modifiers.\n\nPart II - Mechanism Assurance: This part affects the player and is used by the Eternal Empire series, Infinite Empire series, $Name_kuat$ series, and Watcher series. The Eternal Empire series portion is the most important part of this mod. This mechanic ensures the full functionality of the flagship system and the combat capabilities of the Eternal fleets.\n\nLastly, Supply Zones enhance flagship effects and weaken Dynamic Modifiers. This mechanic is mainly generated by Eternal Fortresses and Citadels, encouraging local defense operations. The effects are as follows:\n1. Supply Zones increase the supply cap of the affected systems. Within the cap, Super Flagships gain 600% stacking bonus in combat, 1+2 Flagships gain 300%, and single Flagships gain 100%. Output beyond the cap is reduced to base Flagship levels.\n2. Supply Zones provide Flagship fleets with combat energy reserves. Once fully loaded, Flagships can support 4 battles outside of Supply Zones, each reducing the stacking bonus by 25%. The reserves are replenished after 60 days within a Supply Zone."
 exe_invasion.1004.3.desc:0 "Event Effects. Primarily used by the Infinite Empire series, $Name_kuat$ series, and Watcher series, these special event mechanics function as random combat events, with different effects for different factions.\n\nThe Infinite Empire has the ability to regenerate after being destroyed. The Wandering Defense Fleets have replication capabilities. The $Name_kuat$ series can randomly reduce enemy ships' cyclic damage for a short period. The Watchers and $Name_kuat$ series operate under the same principle."
 exe_invasion.1004.4.desc:0 "Stabilization Mechanism. This part primarily affects the Eternal Empire and Infinite Empire. The Stabilization Mechanic is designed to maintain stable event resolution and abnormal reactivation. For example, if the Eternal Empire invasion crisis is forcibly terminated by an event chain, the Stabilization Mechanism will re-trigger it.

Was this merely a puzzle set by an unknown entity for outsiders? Driven by curiosity, our scientific team conducted a thorough search across the planet for similar signal frequencies. The result: two more identical signals were found at similar depths, forming an equilateral triangle with the first.\n\nJudging from the signal transmission directions of the three sources, perhaps something lies at the center of this triangle? With that in mind, our scientific team relocated directly above the triangle's center and began a new round of excavation. This will take some time to yield results."

Analysis of the gate's cut samples suggests it may have existed for thousands of years, possibly even longer.\n\nAlthough slightly disappointing, in order to uncover the secrets hidden behind the gate, the accompanying engineering team installed cutting equipment and created an entry large enough for large-scale exploration equipment. Drones were then deployed inside. Preliminary drone scans show that the space beyond the gate is vast, filled with various mysterious electronic devices. Strangely, most of these devices are either powered down or damaged, with only a massive central column and scattered emergency green lights still operational.\n\nFurther exploration is undoubtedly necessary. We have also discovered numerous branching chambers and many electronic instruments that are either shut down or slightly damaged. Moreover, the central column is highly likely the core of the entire underground facility.

Our scientific teams have begun preparing radiation- and heat-resistant equipment to study the star.\n\nHowever, the information we can gather from the star itself is minimal.

This type of celestial body has previously only existed in theory, with no historical records confirming its existence.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a historic discovery, greatly exciting our research team. Combined with our previous findings, Isotope-5, a rare material, can not only be used to construct powerful ships but may also alter planetary properties. This conclusion represents a major advancement in our understanding of astrophysics. If this theory is further developed, we may even gain the ability to control stars.\n\nSince stars are the ultimate source of energy and matter dispersal in the universe, their nuclear fusion and life cycles form the basic elements of all physical reality.

With the help of Isotope-5, we can transform stars into topological structures to navigate stellar clusters. Such structures combine luminosity, matter, gravity, and energy distribution, representing both a temporary state and the result of the cluster's evolution over time.\n\nThis raises another question: if the white hole is a topological structure transformed by Isotope-5, how can we use it to access hidden possible worlds between and within stars, and how will it affect the galactic environment? If this theory holds, what can we expect from our control over stars? And if this white hole was artificially transformed, who did it, and what were their purposes?

After thousands of years of operation, for unknown reasons, the ancient civilization perished. They relocated most of the facility's components using unknown methods and concealed the system's coordinates from star charts to prevent discovery.\n\nRecently, someone activated or destroyed the remaining facilities, injecting large amounts of Isotope-5 into the star, triggering a massive coronal mass ejection. The star was subsequently transformed into a white hole. Regarding the ancient remains, their examination has left our research team in disbelief. These bodies appear to be stitched together from multiple different organisms, with different DNA in different body parts, yet their exteriors appear seamless.

Considering that civilizations capable of intergalactic travel are relatively rare on a galactic scale, we may be the first visitors in tens of millions of years.\n\nWe are currently scanning the entire space as part of standard procedures.

 kuat_extramonster.355.a.desc: "The Stellar Gods constructed a massive Dyson array around the star Caroline in this Sector. Caroline was covered by a massive grid, forming a Dyson Sphere network. This network is linked by energy collectors and storage facilities. As for the civilization that used it, no one knows them, no one has seen them. They are ancient even to $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$. The only thing we know is that the Stellar Gods were masters of spatial control and time wormhole technology. They used their facilities to distort the laws of space-time, creating the space known as Anoix between Unterraum and reality.\n\n$Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$, as vassals of the Stellar Gods, specialized in virtual reality, neural interface technology, and cryogenic science. Through the wormhole in the 'Point of No Return' system, they expanded their civilization into our galaxy, establishing a massive fortress in what is now the Void Exclusion Zone, and constructing a gigantic observation outpost. However, spacetime technology carried great risks. The isolated Anoix space could not be accepted by either Unterraum or reality. The Stellar Gods' technology triggered severe wormhole collapses. As time and space twisted, the Stellar Gods completely collapsed, and their colonies vanished without a trace. No one knows exactly what happened, but their presence in the galaxy was eventually hidden by time within the Void of the 'God's Frontier'.\n\nDuring that event, $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$ survived by placing their entire civilization aboard massive arks, drifting through the cosmos at just above light speed. Thus, most of their race remained in a virtual reality environment in suspended animation. This environment is known as—The Construct. From that point on, they began calling themselves the 'Inhdunani'.\n\nInside the Construct, simulated time dilation was used, allowing their civilization to develop rapidly after the crisis, surpassing anything imaginable in the physical world. Soon, the limitations of reality could no longer bind this new civilization."
 kuat_extramonster.355.b: "§EReport Two: Suspended Life§!"
 kuat_extramonster.355.b.desc: "Because they inherited the Stellar Gods' technological path, but the Stellar Gods' technology was incomplete, they fell into this trap. The technology of suspended life created a conflict between self-awareness and physical body development, giving rise to consciousness erosion. To protect the safety of their consciousness and ensure they still existed in reality, the Inhdunani established a law in their early days known as—The One Mind, One Body Doctrine. Simply put, if a person had a consciousness within the Construct, they must have a corresponding physical body in reality. This served two purposes: first, to ensure that everything within the Construct had once been their kin, but the Construct itself was eventually modified to use the brains of connected individuals as part of its computing system. Therefore, removing a physical body would damage part of the Construct, potentially taking part of the Construct with it.\n\nThese syndromes are not truly diseases in the conventional sense, but rather genetic design flaws. These flaws caused all Inhdunani to eventually fall into depression, madness, and death after sufficient time had passed. Eventually, the Inhdunani turned to those living within the Construct, seeking a cure for the disease. The only solution was to join the Construct and enter suspended life alongside them. This period of history is known as the 'Isolation Days'. No one, not even the surviving Inhdunani, seems to fully understand what happened during those days."

The remaining Inhdunani continued to struggle in other regions of Anoix, continuing their battle against the disease while secretly observing the young empires emerging from the Dark Age.\n\nUltimately, the combination of modern expansion and the disease's effects forced the Inhdunani Empire to retreat further and further from our galaxy. However, as one empire fell, another would rise.\n\nAt this time, the Inhdunani were in a chaotic era. Deep within Anoix, some Inhdunani driven mad by genetic disease chose to fall into corruption. They used forbidden technologies on themselves, violating the One Mind, One Body Doctrine. Over time, these mad Inhdunani came to be known as '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$'. At the moment they abandoned the doctrine, they were already dead, but their physical bodies were kept alive through forbidden technology. By violating the One Mind, One Body Doctrine, their very existence was a great offense to the living."

 kuat_extramonster.355.d.desc: "Although $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$ ultimately defeated $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ in the War of the Abyss, most of $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$'s Constructs were damaged during the war. $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$ had to build new Constructs to house their civilization. When the $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$ transmitted their consciousness between Constructs, the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ hitched a ride, inserting themselves into the Constructs of $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$. From that moment on, nearly all $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$ felt a persistent dark whisper in their minds.\n\nThe $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ quickly seized control of parts of the consciousness, forcing them to open the assembly halls of $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$, stealing the suspended bodies of $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$. They imprisoned and enslaved the resisting $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$, injecting their consciousness into machines while their physical bodies were stolen by the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$.\n\nThe $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ who gained freedom within the Construct built massive hives and launched large-scale attacks on $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$'s enclaves. From the data we obtained from $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$, the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ have already gained access to the Death Zone of the Abyss. They are harassing a powerful force located in the Death Zone of the Abyss, and that force seems to regard the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ as the heir to the Second Inhdunani Empire, unaware that the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ are artificial creations.\n\nThis ancient war has now spread into modern times. Then, something unexpected happened to the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$. The stars within the Domain of Vira, as we now know it, were linked together by the Anoix Stellar Gods. They achieved this by constructing a Dyson swarm around the stars and using this energy to create rifts in reality, traversing them using static gates.\n\nCaroline Star, due to the destruction of its isotope-5 storage facility, released explosive energy through the network into the star, damaging the surrounding Dyson lattice. A few years later, the star exploded, causing a much larger explosion deep within the chambers of Anoix. This event destroyed all hyperlanes and wormholes in Anoix, trapping the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ inside, unable to escape. This event became known as the 'Caroline Star' incident."

The singularity has begun producing intense and unstable gravitational tides.\n\nSince the star is located at the outer edge of the Black Hole's accretion disk, fluctuations in cloud mass density further exacerbate this instability. Therefore, the galactic environment in this region is extremely harsh. This may also be the reason why '$Name_G_1$' suddenly appeared before the world after countless ages of silence.”\n\n§GThe Abyss node located at $Name_G_1$ has fallen from the Abyss, and it is precisely this node that allows the reconstruction of Abyssal technology information.

After being artificially stabilized, it was transformed into a Gateway. After the '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$' crisis, the galactic plague swept through Anoix, destroying and assimilating everything there. Even after being assimilated by the '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$', the Inhdunani continue their eternal struggle against them. Once a paradise, the Domain of Vira has now become a wasteland after repeated catastrophes. The Abyss is a space created by the Inhdunani through their understanding of hyperspace mathematics and spatial manipulation. They use special 'tunnels' to travel between Abyssal regions, seemingly similar to stabilized hyperspace bubble technology. The exact principles remain unclear. Their understanding of these theories is thousands of years ahead of ours. Even now, we cannot fully grasp the essence of these technologies."

 kuat_extramonster.38.d.resp: "The military technology of the '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$' far surpasses our imagination. Each of their warships' turrets employs warp technology, channeling the energy of the ship's warp core through an isotope-5 matrix into the warp accelerator. The resulting vortex field output is wound within a prism and then released radially from the core as a particle beam into an anti-polarity compressed acceleration field. These subatomic particles violently collide within the accelerator, undergoing critical heating and combining into a dense quark-gluon plasma superfluid pool. Through the prism effect, this is redirected outward, forming a narrow, spiral-shaped beam of luminous exotic matter—a Lance—capable of piercing targets with immense force. Moreover, these turrets operate independently, floating on the ship's hull via special electromagnetic fields. This design eliminates the resistance of turret rotation, allowing them to hit even the fastest targets orbiting the ship. Combined with cryogenic and thermal management technologies, rapid firing becomes possible. This may be the most efficient starship weapon design we can imagine.\n\nSimilar technologies are widely applied in other modules of their ships, explaining why even our most advanced ships, despite numerical superiority, cannot achieve favorable combat exchange ratios. Competing against such a technological monster is practically bullying. Now that we have mastered related technologies, perhaps we can try building their ships."

When these white holes are fully transformed into singularities, the violent spacetime expansion will shatter the Strength of $Name_Kuat_Contractor$, and at that time, the fleets of $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ will no longer be able to use white hole transmutation to invade our world.\n\nIn any case, to create such a bomb, we need to collect some enemy wreckage, which means we will need to destroy a sufficient number of enemies next."

 kuat_extramonster.32.1.desc:0 "Our scientific team has successfully extracted important clues regarding the suppression of white hole transmutation from the first batch of $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ fleets. Now we can confirm that after $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ injects its unique element, the matter ejection characteristics of the white hole can provide enough energy for the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ fleet to intervene in reality, connecting the Abyss with reality. However, this support is unidirectional, and if reversed back to the star, it will cause irreversible effects.\n\nTherefore, we only need to utilize the unique element from the $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ fleet and re-inject it into a white hole undergoing matter ejection. This will cause the transmuting white hole to undergo reverse transformation, leading to a massive energy collapse.\n\nPerhaps it's time for us to act."

Isotope-5 enables the shield energy to be focused and redirected, allowing the system to attack fast and difficult-to-track targets."

When the incoming attack reaches a critical threshold, the ship's core Isotope-5 reverses the stored energy and directs it toward a target locked by the weapon system, focusing the matrix at a single point under the control of Isotope-5.\n\nThen, core particles radiate toward the focal point, combining into quark-gluon plasma and firing toward the target with unparalleled force."
