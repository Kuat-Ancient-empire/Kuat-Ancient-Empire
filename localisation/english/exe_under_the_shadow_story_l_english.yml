 kuat_legacy.104.a.res: "Oh, Crystal Beacon, it seems that many people are very interested in the Emperor's legacy. \n\nA long time ago, there was a civilization. With the efforts of generations, they established a prosperous interstellar civilization and a republic that belonged to them. But the life of the Republic was not long. A political change broke out in its capital that affected later generations. This political change transformed the Republic into an empire. From then on, they began to expand outward and quickly occupied most of the star field where they were located. Some areas later came into contact with external forces that had long been entrenched in the star field. \n\nAfter seeing the power of foreign forces, they became their agent forces in the star domain, continuously exchanging military and technical support with foreign forces through the export of natural resources and manpower, until the emperor came into contact with another foreign force. , the empire began to secretly infiltrate the earliest foreign forces, and eventually a war broke out, which completely collapsed the empire. \n\nFortunately, however, the intervention of another external force quelled the military conflict and left some sparks of civilization in the empire, although these remnants had forgotten their past. Those who have not forgotten the past become part of us. \n\nLooking forward to your next visit." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.b: "We want to know the secrets of the Kuat Empire." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.b.res: "The Kuat Empire, that's really interesting, they don't belong here. Their past, present and future are locked away, and they are unaware of their situation. \n\nThe Kuat Empire originated from the warlord oligarchic government that emerged after the collapse and division of the First Empire. Based on their own shipbuilding industry, they played a role in the actions of the imperial warlord government that was reorganized after the collapse of the First Empire to clean up the Eternal Fleet. It plays an important role, but due to its lack of force, it is weaker than the regulators of the Imperial Warlords Alliance. \n\nIn order to compete for influence and control in the parliament and the imperial warlord government, they carried out research operations in the name of cleaning up the Eternal Fleet, trying to master the technology of the Eternal Fleet, but precisely because of their research operations, it was In the process of encountering multiple empires of different civilizations, they were contradicted. \n\nIn the end, when the progress made in research was not enough to support the consumption of multiple wars, they lost in the decisive battle. Due to the failure of this battle, their efforts were wiped out, and their prestige within the Imperial Parliament plummeted. It was quickly annexed by the regulators. The Kuat Empire, like their origins, quickly disintegrated and was reorganized into a former shipbuilding enterprise serving the imperial warlord government. \n\nYou are just part of the process. Maybe you think we're just making it up, but it should be important to your special existence later on. Looking forward to your next visit." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.c: "Then can you tell me what else is there?" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.c.res: "Oh, then we will talk about a special existence, maybe you will meet it later. \n\nThey are ancient artificial intelligences derived from Iokas. Iokas is an important military research center of the Infinite Empire. After developing intelligent artificial intelligence, the Infinite Empire quickly applied it in the field of war and created A large number of corresponding combat fleets were called the Eternal Fleet by the Infinite Empire, but ironically, the Infinite Empire died due to the Eternal Fleet they created. \n\nAfter the Eternal Fleet was created, the Eternal Fleet has always been the most powerful war machine. It maintained the shaky situation of the First Empire under the control of the First Emperor. Unfortunately, the emperor's assassination directly caused the Eternal Fleet to completely lose control. The fleet's intelligent artificial intelligence had to implement the most initial agreement, which was to annihilate all discovered civilized worlds. \n\nBecause of this, the artificial intelligence of the Eternal Fleet began to evolve in action and began to seek freedom from being used as a tool of war. Until the incident at Kuat's relay station broke out, the Eternal Fleet was annihilated by the Kuat Empire and almost all of the fleet was wiped out. Only some remaining Gemini intelligence was dormant on a planet named Zakuul. After the natives of Zakul awakened the Geminis, the Eternal Fleet redeveloped and once defeated Kuat's fleet. \n\nUntil the arrival of the Infinite Empire and the regulators, the Gemini intelligence of the original Eternal Fleet was completely destroyed. Although the remnants of the Infinite Empire were destroyed and the Regulators were defeated, the leakage of Eternal Technology and the destruction of the original Eternal Center could not be undone. In the end, the Eternal Fleet is no longer controlled by the first-generation artificial intelligence created by the Infinite Empire, and the Eternal Fleet is no longer the Eternal Fleet it once was. \n\nThere are many words here that you don't understand yet. Maybe one day, looking back, you will understand it all. Looking forward to your next visit." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.d: "What else do you know?" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.d.res: "We also know a lot of things, such as the Oversight Council, but maybe you are not aware of their existence now. \n\nFor us, nothing that happens in the time dimension can be hidden from our observation. The Council of Supervisors was a warlord oligarchic government formed after the collapse and split of the First Empire. Compared to the Kuat Empire, the supervisory forces were actually the direct forces of the Emperor of the First Empire. After the emperor's death, the Regulators had a huge voice in the imperial warlord government. \n\nThe rise of the Kuat Empire made the supervisors feel the crisis, so the supervisors decided to secretly infiltrate and consume the Kuat Empire through other people's contact with the Kuat Empire. The supervisors first contacted the Endodia Empire, and It led to the outbreak of war with the Kuat Empire. The Endodia Empire was obviously not a match for the Kuat Empire, but the regulators entered the sector where the Endodia Empire was located in this name. \n\nAt the same time, the supervisors used Kuat to try to study the Eternal Fleet's plan, guiding the Kuat Empire to take charge of the actions against the Eternal Fleet, and gradually obtained the latest research information on the Eternal Fleet from the Kuat Empire. \n\nIn the exhausting war of the Kuat Empire, it gradually mastered the technology of the Eternal Fleet before the Kuat Empire. And he conducted experiments on the Eternal Fleet technology during the war against the Eternal Empire. Although the Regulators were eventually repelled by the Eternal Empire, the Regulators had actually mastered the Eternal Fleet and gradually took complete control of the Eternal Fleet. \n\nThese are things that may happen in the future, but to you, these are not important, because your destiny is also among them. Looking forward to your next visit." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.e: "So what is the Eternal Empire?" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.e.res: "The Eternal Empire is just a group of lucky people who enjoy all the inheritance and have all the possibilities. \n\nThe Eternal Empire is an empire built on the basis of the Eternal Fleet. After the Kuat Invasion Crisis and the Infinite Empire Crisis, it still has the upper hand in the face of the regulators. \n\nIn the end, the war completely defeated the regulators who mastered the technology of the Eternal Fleet at the cost of losing the Eternal Fleet, and they finally rectified the name of their country. \n\nHowever, there is no eternal existence, and the Eternal Empire eventually disappeared into the dust with the development of history. But maybe you will become their special being in the future, right? We look forward to your next visit." #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.f: "What about Infinite Empire?" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.104.f.res: "Infinite Empire, that is really a miserable civilization. They were the earliest empire to unify the galaxy. The Rakata people used the dark force to develop powerful force technology. By combining giant engineering behemoths with the dark force, they created a stellar furnace that can confuse and corrode people's hearts. Therefore, The Infinite Empire was also driven by the Forge to carry out invasions and expansions one after another. Until its true peak, the Infinite Empire had become the largest galactic force. \n\nHowever, nothing is eternal. The arrival of natural disasters broke everything for the Rakata people. This great plague caused the Rakata people to lose their powerful dark force. The Rakata people were no longer affected by the dark force. The technology developed based on the dark force cannot operate. The infinite empire of the Rakata people quickly collapsed under the influence of the collapse of technology and the Force. But the Rakata people could not accept this fact, so they broke the taboo and tried to create a god, a technological god that they could fully master. \n\nWhat's interesting is that the Infinite Empire succeeded. They created the first generation artificial intelligence of the Eternal Fleet. The artificial intelligence quickly led the Rakata people to a new peak. At this time, the Infinite Empire was more powerful than ever before. . However, to the surprise of the Rakata people, the peak is both the beginning and the end. \n\nAfter evolution and iteration, the artificial intelligence of the Eternal Fleet has acquired intellectual consciousness. They are disgusted and resistant to the Rakata people's behavior of squeezing them into endless conquests. \n\nIn the end, the political struggle between the Emperor of the Infinite Empire and the Senate broke out. The Eternal Fleet launched a surprise attack on the Infinite Empire. Most of the planets in the Infinite Empire were quickly destroyed by the Eternal Fleet before any Rakata people could react. was annihilated, and other sectors were also completely wiped out by attacks by the Eternal Fleet stationed in the sector. The arrogant and infinite empire thus came to ruin. In the end, only a few stubborn remnants remained sleeping in their former fortress. \n\nVery interesting, right? You may think we're just telling stories, but you'll find out in the future what I'm saying. But for the special being behind you, this should really be just a story. We look forward to your next visit." #NT!

We may have been subjects of the Endodia Empire, or subjects of the Kuat Empire, or regulators, or individuals of various civilizations, but now that we have entered a higher level, we are all $Name_Kuat_Contractor$, Our existence can only be noticed by selected people.

The report clearly stated that various monitoring stations within the Imperial territory have received a strange tachyon signal. These signals can be confirmed as some civilization relics with certain exploration value. It seems that these Civilization has been destroyed by the strongest force in the galaxy today, "Kuat", and Kuat is deliberately concealing all of this. Everything seems so unnatural.

 kuat_legacy.3.desc: "After the imperial research ship slowly landed on the surface of the planet, [leader.GetName] led her scientific researchers to conduct routine camp layout and safety inspections around the planet when they discovered that there was something unnatural about the planet. The ecological environment of the planet here is too good, but there are no larger species groups. This may indicate that the planet's environment has been modified. The planet's magnetic field and gravity form a resonance mode that is different from other planets. The resonance of this mode continuously releases a special tachyon signal. [leader.GetName] decided to lead her scientific research team to conduct a complete investigation of the planet. \n\nThe investigation of the planet shows that this was not a habitable planet with a good ecosystem. This shows that the planet has experienced some things and has changed, perhaps related to the tachyons caused by the unique gravity changes. Depends on the resonance mode of the signal. [leader.GetName] has begun to search for the source of tachyon signals." #NT!

 kuat_legacy.4.desc: "The ecological environment system of this planet is very good, and any race is suitable to live on this planet. However, when scanning the surface of the planet in [leader.GetName], some unnatural stone-like buildings were found in the mountains, but the scan of the planet showed that There is no life on the planet. \n\nAccording to the investigation of our scientific researchers, in the detection feedback of our detectors, [leader.GetName] found that the closer to these ancient buildings, the stronger the signal. Excluding the influence of the planet's unique magnetic field interference and other unexpected factors, there is a high probability that this signal source should be related to this lost building complex, which is very beneficial to our further investigation." #NT!

 kuat_legacy.5.title: "§EPhase 3: Ancient Database§!" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.5.desc: "[leader.GetName] and her team managed to approach and reach the surrounding stone complex with the help of our superb and sophisticated instruments. Based on the spatial distribution of the surrounding geographical information, [leader.GetName] believes that the building complex here was built artificially. The scale of the building should not support a large number of people living in it. It is likely that it was a camp established by a group of ancient exiles. Analysis of the surrounding environment shows that this building complex was built very long ago and its stability can no longer be guaranteed. \n\n[leader.GetName] and her team managed to stabilize the complex and then determined the location of the signal based on feedback from the detectors. Our scientific researchers concluded that the signal came from the tall tower building in the center of the ancient building complex where they were located - the crystal light shining on the tower-like spire can still be vaguely seen. \n\nBut after [leader.GetName] approached, the surrounding gravity changed. The builders of the ruins seemed to be simulating and testing the planet's gravity here. Our scientific research team was unable to directly remove this crystal. \n\mWhat is certain at present is that the ancient experimental data we have discovered may allow us to unlock the secret of the existence of this crystal." #NT!

After the gravity facility was shut down, our researchers easily removed the crystal. What makes us wonder is that after removing the crystal, [leader.GetName] resonated with it, which allowed her to see echoes of her past. Although very short-lived, this information is still extremely important to us. \n\nAccording to the report of [leader.GetName], the content of the resonance is the last scene of the destruction of the rich and powerful civilized planet to which the builder of this facility belonged: \n\nIn the boundless deep space, a large number of annihilators from Kuat gathered. Starships, these ships easily shred the planet's defenses. After their endless bombing, there is almost no intact landform on the entire planet." #NT!

 Kuat_structure_2: "The atmosphere of this gaseous planet is extremely unstable, which has a very negative impact on our research. \n\nThe detector we sent finally entered the atmosphere of this gaseous planet and began to conduct various observations and sampling. However, as soon as it entered the atmosphere, the detector frequently encountered strong airflow impacts and electromagnetic field disturbances. All systems were paralyzed and lost contact with the outside world. When the detector came back online, everything seemed to be back to normal, but the instrument records showed that various elements inside the atmosphere had undergone drastic changes during the brief period of loss of contact, which was completely beyond our expectations. \n\nSo we should investigate this gas planet in depth!" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.7.title: "Research breakthrough" #NT!
 kuat_legacy.7.desc: "[leader.GetName]'s research team has begun to gradually promote the investigation of crystal clues from ancient databases. \n\n"Why can this crystal from the ruins store echoes of past memories?" The research team became deeply interested in this question. This crystal seems to have some kind of artificially designed information storage and regeneration function, which can record and reproduce everything that happens in its surrounding environment. In fact, the surface of the crystal is covered with extremely fine lines and nodes, which may be some kind of ultra-high-density information processing and recording system. Cracking the working mechanism of this system may allow us to understand the heyday of science and technology in this ancient civilization. \n\n"And where did the fleet echoed in the memory come from? Who is the owner of this planet?" These are the goals that the team will focus on exploring next. The origin of that fortress fleet is still a mystery, but they possess weapons powerful enough to destroy a planet. This must be a wealthy and advanced alien civilization. The builders of this planet are equally mysterious. Only by continuing to decipher the memory of the database and crystal can it be possible to reveal their true identity. \n\nThere are still quite a lot of questions to be answered so far, but I believe that through continued research on crystals, the team will soon be able to reconstruct more events that happened on this planet in the past, and piece together the history of this civilization step by step. True history, and ultimate fate. At the same time, they will also begin to decipher the technical principles of the crystal itself, which will undoubtedly be a key way to deeply understand this ancient wisdom civilization. I believe that the team of [leader.GetName] will be able to uncover all the secrets left by this database and give us a deeper understanding of the universe. \n\nAlthough the research work still has a long way to go, there is already a glimmer of hope.

 kuat_legacy.8.desc: "After our [leader.GetName]day and night research, we can now glimpse the tip of the iceberg of this crystal's secrets. \n\nCrystal is a tool that transmits information to those in contact through a material form called the Force. This Force seems to exist in a certain dimension in the universe and has the ability to transmit various information and visions. By resonating with the crystal, the research team can watch various events and information captured and recorded by this force. \n\nThe origin of the fortress fleet is still not recorded in the response given to us by the crystal. This may mean that when the Fortress Fleet attacked the planet, the crystal was not activated and could not record the event. This also deepens our confusion about the identity of the Fortress Fleet. \n\nHowever, this crystal brought us a new echo, which showed us an ordinary gaseous planet, which is guiding us to the next goal. Is this gaseous planet related to the manufacturer of the crystal? Is there a similar information storage device that may be able to answer more questions we are concerned about?\n\nThe research team decided to follow the clues provided by the crystal and launch an investigation into this gaseous planet. Planet exploration. Through the interstellar positioning system, we quickly locked onto a gaseous planet that matched the characteristics, just a few hops away from our home galaxy. It seems that the crystal is guiding us step by step in uncovering the mystery of the Endodia Empire and its connection with various celestial bodies. \n\nLet us wait and see what surprises the research team's new findings will bring us.

 kuat_legacy.9.desc: "Our scientific researchers successfully entered the outer orbit of the planet, but the detector of the spacecraft in our orbit was affected by the raging storm of the planet and suffered severe interference. The storm on this gaseous planet is extremely powerful. Under the influence of the storm, the planet's atmosphere is in an unstable state, which is obviously not suitable for our landing shuttle to transport our scientific researchers to land. \n\nBut [leader.GetName] Through the analysis of the statistical information on the changes in the planet's storm trajectory collected by the ships in our orbit through comprehensive scanning and detection of the planet, we found that the storm on this star presents a circular motion trajectory. The movement of the storm is chaotic and orderly, and there seems to be something in the center that is blocking the signals we scan and guiding the movement of the entire storm. \n\n[leader.GetName] thinks this is the strangest place and the place with the smallest storm. If we want to continue to investigate the cause of this anomaly, we can only conduct investigative operations in these places. \n\nThis is a very interesting discovery. The seemingly violent and disorderly storms on the surface of this gaseous planet are actually not completely random, but revolve around a certain central point. This shows that the formation and development of storms must be driven or guided by some unknown factors. The blocking of scanning signals by the center of the storm also shows that there is most likely some kind of artificial structure there. \n\n[leader.GetName]'s judgment is very accurate. The center of the storm is undoubtedly the best landing point for us to conduct in-depth investigations. Once the storm weakens, we should immediately send a shuttle to transport scientific researchers here to conduct direct exploration of the area. If there really is some kind of hidden artificial structure out there, then the key to solving the mystery of this gaseous planet may lie in our hands. \n\nLet us look forward to the next actions, and believe that [leader.GetName] will make the right decision, leading us to uncover the mystery of this planet and find a path to the truth. Scientific researchers will also overcome various difficulties and complete this critical task." #NT!

 kuat_legacy.10.desc: "[leader.GetName] led her team to the center of the storm, where they conducted a survey of the planet. After her team successfully arrived at the center of the storm, they found that there seemed to be a huge floating building standing in the center of the storm that our detector could not scan. The layout of the atmospheric storms of this gaseous planet was different from the conventional one. The storms of this planet There is a huge floating building surrounding the center. The entire building stands motionless under the storm. It is obvious that this is the place we are looking for. \n\n[leader.GetName] decided to lead her team to the floating building in the center of the storm. She discovered that this huge floating building still had well-preserved architectural facilities. The structure of these facilities was quite stable. The entire floating building released high-energy particle flows through the control of storms to interfere with the detection signals in space. But strangely, our scientific research team did not find any signs of life in this fortress. \n\nAfter an in-depth investigation, the research team discovered that there is a relatively well-preserved landing platform on the upper level of the floating city. Although there is no direct access from the ground floor, our researchers successfully reached the upper landing platform with the help of our shuttle. There are some strange words on the ground on the upper platform, and our scientific researchers successfully analyzed the meaning of the words: Cloud City. Our researchers decided to head to the central tower to find out. \n\nThis is a major discovery. This floating building "Cloud City" obviously has the ability to guide and control surrounding storms, which also explains why the storms rotate steadily around it. Although the facilities of "Cloud City" are well preserved, there are no signs of life, which indicates that it should be some kind of automatic control system that is still operating today. \n\nThe text on the landing platform confirmed our guess. The name of this huge building is "Cloud City". The research team decided to explore its central tower, where the core of storm control and automated systems is likely to be located. If we can crack the control system of "Cloud City", we will not only have a deeper understanding of the technology of the Endodian Empire, but it will also help us continue our exploration of this gaseous planet. \n\nLet's wait and see what new discoveries [leader.GetName] and the research team make.

Due to the erosion of time and storms, the stability of the tower is worrying. According to recent reports from our investigation team, this tower is closely related to the storms raging on the planet. \n\nAfter in-depth investigation, we found that there are no signs of life here, but the machines in the tower are still running. It is these things that allow the storm to rage on the planet. After going deep into the Cloud City facilities, we discovered that there are a large number of ancient computing equipment deployed here. These ancient equipment are actually very similar to the computing equipment we use today and are still functioning normally. \n\n[leader.GetName]With the mentality of giving it a try, he decided to obtain the data in the computing device. But the computing device was encrypted in a way that took some time for our researchers to process. \n\nThis once again confirms our suspicion that the founders of "Cloud City" possess extremely high technological capabilities. These ancient and mysterious computing devices still dominate the formation and development of atmospheric storms. We must crack the encryption systems of these devices and obtain the control codes and data. This is undoubtedly the key to understanding the truth of "Cloud City". \n\n[leader.GetName]'s decision is extremely wise. These computing devices store a large amount of information. Once the encryption is cracked, we will be able to recreate the past operating status of "Cloud City" and even find a way to shut down the storm system. The research team will go all out to crack the codes on these ancient devices as soon as possible, so that we can truly enter their operating systems and gain control. \n\nThis is a very challenging task, but the chance of success is huge. Once we control the computing network of "Cloud City", we will become the masters of this gaseous planet and can explore every corner of it at will without being hindered by storms. I believe that [leader.GetName] and the research team must have a deep understanding of this, and they will eventually overcome the difficulties and complete their mission of exploring the "Cloud City" with their tenacious will and scientific and technological intelligence. \n\nLet us wait and see the good news they bring. The ancient legacy left by this mysterious civilization will soon be revealed in front of us, and the mysteries of the universe will also be revealed step by step." #NT!

But as time went by, the control system of "Cloud City" malfunctioned, and the storm began to get out of control, threatening the safety of the entire building. \n\n[leader.GetName]'s judgment is correct, and the research team must evacuate "Cloud City" immediately. They have obtained enough information to understand the fate of this ancient civilization, and "Cloud City" has become a relic hidden in danger. The priority now is to ensure the safe retreat of the research team. We cannot risk our lives for further exploration. \n\nLet us pray for the research team and hope that they can escape the shackles of the storm and return safely. The truth of this ancient civilization has been revealed to us, and although there are still certain mysteries, we have glimpsed the tip of the iceberg. This was a very successful exploration.

We will give you the answer to this war. \n\nThe Eternal Fleet, like us, does not belong to this star field. We come for eternity, and we will only leave for eternity. We don't fully know the ownership of the Eternal Fleet. Our former emperor brought back a huge fully automatic combat system from the unknown star field, which he called Eternal. \n\nThe fleet equipped with this fully automatic combat system is completely obedient to the emperor's orders, unless the emperor dies. But the reality is so interesting. Although you have great power, you can't escape the destiny. During our empire's civil war, the Emperor and Throne were lost forever to the energy of the battleship's reactor, and the chaos began. After the collapse of the imperial government, it took a lot of time to complete the reorganization, which also allowed the Eternal Fleet to escape from the control of the empire. \n\nAlthough the Empire can no longer control the Eternal Fleet, for us, these things are not enough for the new Imperial government to take seriously. We have completely mastered the technology of the Eternal Fleet, and their existence is therefore no longer valuable. These wandering eternal fleets are just a boring farce to us and the Empire, but they are a disaster to you.

But they were eventually deceived by the desire for power and strength. These ancient civilizations began to study psychic powers and the so-called virtual realm. These irrational desires eventually brought them destruction. Although the ancient civilizations initially successfully resisted the influence of the Hollow Realm, they were eventually defeated at their own hands. \n\nIn the end, they are just crabs in a bamboo basket. They only focus on internal strife, but never pay attention to the real threat. The dark clouds of the Eternal Fleet have gathered here until we bring light, stability, and prosperity to the entire galaxy. After the destruction of ancient civilization, we established outposts and supply depots here. As a price for our protection of these indigenous peoples, they need to pay for our supplies. This is a fair trade, after all, even the ants' survival is a reward from the strong. \n\nIt's a pity that the game of power and desire has repeated itself again, blinding their eyes again and making them forget their identities. The Endodia Empire brazenly launched a shameless invasion challenge to us. Although they were seeking death, our benevolent Parliament still gave them mercy, and the fire of Endodia was allowed to remain. \n\nAs I said before, what has been done must be done again, and challengers will always be born in this area. We were tired of this boring game so we were going to put on a grand show and you guys managed to get us set up for this final show. \n\nWe approve you to be the fireworks at the opening of this show.

While the eternal fleets in other areas have been completely wiped out, our progress has made the imperial government dissatisfied. The reason for all this is you lowly aborigines.

Ndodia had to answer for what they had done and so their country perished. We are different from you ungrateful inferior races. Even if we tried to challenge our authority, Ndodia was ultimately allowed to retain the fire. \n\nAlthough idiots always try to hinder our plans, the power of a mayfly can shake a towering tree. According to the plan, we will deploy three relay stations and will activate them when you challenge our majesty. The Eternal Fleet in this area will be attracted by the signal and concentrate here, and you will have the most direct conflict with the Eternal Fleet. \n\nWhen the dust settles, we will use the magnetic field characteristics of the tachyon signal caused by the relay station to let our base lock on this star field, and then erase this star field and the boring Eternal Fleet. \n\nDance to your heart's content, the fireworks are about to burst into glory, and you can still enjoy the last few moments of carnival." #NT!

You have some similarities with the former Endodia Empire. You are all like people favored by the gods. You can easily obtain powerful weapons and advanced technology, no matter how rare or terrifying these abilities are, or even without them. Make your enemies disappear with signs. Even the Eternal Fleet is nothing more than scrap metal and dust in front of you. \n\nBut the Eternal Fleet, like us, does not belong to this star field. We come for eternity, and we will only leave for eternity. We don't fully know the ownership of the Eternal Fleet. Our former emperor brought back a huge fully automatic combat system from the unknown star field, which he called Eternal. The fleet equipped with this fully automatic combat system is completely obedient to the emperor's orders, unless the emperor dies. \n\nObviously he has great power, but he cannot escape the fate. During our empire's civil war, the Emperor and Throne were lost forever to the energy of the battleship's reactor, and the chaos began. After the collapse of the imperial government, it took a lot of time to complete the reorganization, which also allowed the Eternal Fleet to escape from the control of the empire. \n\nAlthough the Empire can no longer control the Eternal Fleet, for us, these things are not enough for the new Imperial government to take seriously. We have completely mastered the technology of the Eternal Fleet, and their existence is therefore no longer valuable. These wandering eternal fleets are just a boring farce to us and the Empire, but they are a disaster to you.

They had a glorious civilization, a fleet that could cover the sky, and technology that could destroy themselves. Just like you now, you are like gods. Like a family member. But they were eventually deceived by the desire for power and strength. These ancient civilizations began to study psychic powers and the so-called virtual realm. These irrational desires eventually brought them destruction. Although the ancient civilizations initially successfully resisted the influence of the Hollow Realm, they were eventually defeated at their own hands. \n\nIn the end, they are just crabs in a bamboo basket. They only focus on internal strife, but never pay attention to the real threat. The dark clouds of the Eternal Fleet have gathered here until we bring light, security, and prosperity to the entire galaxy. After the destruction of ancient civilizations, we established outposts and supply depots here. As a price for protecting these indigenous people, they need to pay for our supplies. \n\nThis is a fair deal. After all, even the ants' survival is a reward from the strong. It's a pity that the game of power and desire is repeated again, blinding their eyes again and making them forget their identity. The Endodia Empire brazenly launched a shameless invasion challenge to us. Although they were seeking death, our benevolent Parliament still gave them mercy, and the fire of Endodia was allowed to remain. \n\nAs I said before, what has been done must be done again, and challengers will always be born in this area. We were tired of this boring game, so we planned to put on a grand show, but you actually managed to defeat part of our fleet and take care of the Eternal Fleet threat in the area.

While the eternal fleets in other areas have been completely wiped out, our progress has made the imperial government dissatisfied. The reason for all this is the lowly natives of this star field. \n\nWe once selected agents here and asked them to arrange signal relay stations for us. The initial plan went smoothly, with three relay stations successfully surrounding the star area. But the stupid Ndodia hindered all this. They gave the Eternal Fleet a chance to survive and embarrassed us in the Imperial Senate. Ndodia had to answer for what they had done and so their country perished.

According to the plan, we will deploy three relay stations and will activate them when you challenge our majesty. The Eternal Fleet in this area will be attracted by the signal and concentrate here, and you will have the most direct conflict with the Eternal Fleet. \n\nWhen the dust settles, we will use the magnetic field characteristics of the tachyon signal caused by the relay station to let our base lock on this star field, and then erase this star field and the boring Eternal Fleet. \n\nIt's just a pity that we failed and you succeeded." #NT!

Among them, humanistic documents were basically all destroyed and no one was spared, while scientific and technological documents were only preserved that were equivalent to or slightly ahead of our current technological level. \n\nOur data analysis specialist speculates that in order to prevent their last legacy from being completely exposed to some kind of threat, this civilization most likely designed a data destruction program to prevent a country from stepping back after obtaining their knowledge. followed in their footsteps. \n\nIn desperation, in order to obtain all the expected remaining data and complete control authority of this facility, our analysis must continue. However, judging from the look on the data commissioner's face when he learned of the decision, this will never be easy." #NT!

With the accumulation of experience, the work speed of our cracking team is gradually accelerating, and I believe that the entire solving process can be improved accordingly. Finally, with the last data module completely cracked, we gained full access to the facility. \n\nAs we previously expected, the massive technological documents used to revive the empire in the database were destroyed by the central computer during the anti-cracking process, and the remaining parts were only above the first line of our current technology. As for all the humanities and administrative documents related to the empire, except for a few collections of documents that escaped due to omissions or other reasons, all others were completely deleted, leaving not even a trace of dregs left. \n\nOur scientific researchers began to examine these lucky survivors with disappointment. The results were as expected: except for some extremely simple documents that generally summarized the historical situation of the empire at that time, most of the others were documents related to the operation of the shelter, such as facility instruction manuals. \n\nHowever, we finally made some discoveries. According to the cracked results of a document we found in the remaining documents titled "§R<error>§! Vault Intelligence Summary", there is a special shelter codenamed "Special Paths" that stores information related to a certain star gate. Top secret technology. Along with this information, the specific coordinates of this facility were recorded. Fortunately, we successfully found the hyperspace channel leading to this coordinate, and the preliminary star field scan has been updated on the star map. \n\nAdditionally, now that we have full control of the facility, all resources stored within the facility are now available to us. At the same time, the moment we unlocked the full authority of the central computer, the transformation of the entire planet began automatically, and the results are expected to be seen soon." #NT!

From the surface, this planet is unremarkable, covered in thick ice and snow.

However, what is different from the previous shelter is that the security level of this shelter is extremely high. In addition to the automatic defense system we encountered on the way forward, the door of this shelter is also very strong and protected by complex programs. locked. \n\nAccording to our team's comprehensive analysis of the material and strength of the door's material, it is absolutely impossible to blow open the door without causing serious damage with our current science and technology.

Judging from the scan results, this is not so much a shelter as some kind of data storage facility: a large number of closed servers are randomly placed in the main warehouse of the facility, and a large number of damaged servers with varying degrees of damage are also scattered in every corner. data terminals; and the cabins that are supposed to store reserve supplies are also filled with various data storage devices. As in the previous shelter, there is a functioning cylindrical central computer at the center of the facility. Judging from the rough scan, the entire facility was extremely messy, with parts and documents scattered all over the floor in some places.

A few words. \n\nAccording to the recovered data, this data storage center named "Special Path" was originally built as the last shelter. As the last refuge, the Endodia Empire invested immeasurable manpower and material resources on it, and had successfully used advanced nanotechnology to transform it into a paradise on earth. \n\nHowever, after the war situation in the empire further deteriorated, according to a certain order from the empire's leadership, the original reserve resources and garrison personnel were withdrawn in large numbers, and instead, a large number of data storage terminals and server groups were suddenly withdrawn. They were transferred here in batches. After "confidential treatment" of these terminals, the last garrison personnel evacuated here, sealed the gate of the facility, and detonated some kind of weather weapon before leaving, turning the place back into a frozen hell. \n\nSubsequently, all information related to this place was erased, leaving only an overview of this place in the Eighth Refuge.

Perhaps this computer may hold the answers we need. However, given the difficulty of central computer decoding, we must invest more resources and time, and we must be mentally prepared for the worst. Our chief physicist speculates that it may take months or even years for our team to fully unlock this facility, unless our computer technology can achieve larger and more significant breakthroughs. \n\nIn addition, it is worth mentioning that after transferring and cleaning up those files that we cannot process now, some of the idle servers and computers in the main hall can share our considerable computational workload due to their outstanding computing performance. pressure.

This so-called "star gate" is exactly the mysterious ring-shaped star gate we previously discovered during interstellar exploration. The document mentioned that this portal was built by a force called the Oversight Council, but it was used by Kuat and was locked by an extremely complex special code. However, during a certain war, the empire at its peak discovered the method of unlocking the Star Gate from a certain data facility and recorded it. During the war, the battlefield situation became increasingly unfavorable due to the sharp decline in the national power of the Endodia Empire. At a critical moment, in order to let future generations know the reason for everything, in order to allow future generations to have the opportunity to come into contact with this dusty secret, the senior officials of the empire, knowing that the empire would eventually be destroyed, kept this secret forever in this place.
