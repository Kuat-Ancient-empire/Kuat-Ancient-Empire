      kuat_lagacy.100.name:"§EStage One: The Storm§!"
      kuat_lagacy.100.desc:"Our scientists have successfully reached the outer orbit of this planet, but the sensors aboard our ships in orbit have experienced severe interference caused by the raging storms on this gas giant. These storms are unusually powerful, clearly making it unsuitable for our landing shuttles to ferry our researchers down to the surface.\n\nHowever, [leader.GetName], after analyzing comprehensive scanning data collected by our ships in orbit regarding the storm's trajectory variations, discovered that the planet's storms follow a circular movement pattern. Though chaotic, the storm patterns are strangely ordered, as if something at the center is obstructing our scanning signals and directing the entire storm system.\n\nThis is a fascinating discovery—the seemingly violent and random storms on the surface of this gas giant are in fact not entirely random, but instead revolve around a central point. This suggests that the formation and development of the storm must be driven or guided by some unknown factor. The signal blockage at the storm's center also strongly indicates the presence of some artificial structure.\n\n[leader.GetName]'s assessment is extremely precise—the storm's center is undoubtedly the best location for further investigation."
      kuat_legacy.100.a:"We must continue the investigation!"

      kuat_lagacy.101.4.desc:"§EStage Two: Cloud City§!"
      kuat_lagacy.101.0.desc:"[leader.GetName] led her team toward the storm's center to conduct planetary investigations. Upon successfully reaching the heart of the storm, they discovered that the previously undetectable center appears to host a massive floating structure. The atmospheric storm patterns of this gas giant differ from the norm—the storm continuously circles around this central floating structure, which remains unmoved despite the surrounding chaos.\n\n[leader.GetName] decided to lead her team toward the floating structure at the storm's center. This colossal floating installation remains largely intact, with its structures remarkably stable. The entire structure emits high-energy particle streams by manipulating the storm, which interfere with space-based scanning signals. Yet curiously, our research team found no signs of life within this fortress.\n\nFurther investigation revealed an open landing platform on the upper levels of the floating structure. Although inaccessible from the lower levels, our researchers successfully reached the upper platform using our shuttle. On the platform's surface were strange inscriptions, which our scientists managed to decipher: *Cloud City*.\n\nThis is a major discovery—the floating structure known as 'Cloud City' clearly possesses the ability to guide and control the surrounding storms."
      kuat_legacy.101.a:"Truly amazing."
      kuat_lagacy.101.1.desc:"§EStage Three: Ancient Imperial Colony§!"
      kuat_legacy.101.b:"[leader.GetName] successfully led her team into the central tower atop the floating island. Located at the summit of the structure, this tower is very likely connected to the raging storms across the planet.\n\nUpon deeper investigation, we discovered that machines within the tower remain operational, and it is these very machines that sustain the planet's violent storms. After further exploration within Cloud City, we found a vast number of ancient computing devices. These relics from antiquity bear striking similarities to our current computing systems and remain fully functional. [leader.GetName] decided to attempt data extraction.\n\nThe information retrieved from these devices further confirmed our suspicions—Cloud City's creators possessed an extremely advanced level of technology. These computing systems continue to control the atmospheric storms to this day. We must crack their encryption systems and obtain the control codes.\n\nOnce we gain control over Cloud City's computational network, we will become the masters of this gas giant, free to explore every corner without being hindered by the storms."
      kuat_lagacy.101.2.desc:"We will uncover this secret."
      kuat_legacy.101.c:"§EStage Four: Collapse§!"
      kuat_lagacy.101.3.desc:"After our researchers extracted the data, they found only a single piece of video footage. Our team played the recording:\n\n§YDear one, our refuge facility has been completed. This facility shall bear your name—'Cloud City'—and will serve to protect our people, allowing our kin to survive this catastrophe.\n\nBut one refuge is not enough. We need many more, yet for now we must part ways, isolated from one another. They will find us eventually. We must organize quickly—our enemies will not let us go. The compromisers' accords did nothing to save us; they are still hunting us. I don't know how long the traces we leave behind will remain. Forget the past—the strength of our former glory is like passing clouds. Our future is now shrouded in darkness.§!\n\nThe footage abruptly ends, and the worn-out equipment within the facility finally reaches the end of its long life.\n\nDue to damage to the computing systems operating within the central tower, the planet's storms have undergone drastic changes. The storms are now spiraling out of control, and the entire structure is no longer safe."

      kuat_legacy.102.a:"The surface of this oceanic world is fully visible, with vast expanses of deep blue water covering most of its surface—calm and serene. Yet beneath this tranquil ocean lies hidden secrets. Deep within its abyssal depths may lie artificial structures or the ruins of an ancient civilization.\n\nThe deep sea has always been the frontier of exploration. This oceanic world is undoubtedly an alluring target. If we can unlock its secrets and venture into the depths, we are sure to uncover astonishing discoveries."

      kuat_legacy.104.0.desc:"Our researchers have made a breakthrough in deciphering the crystal we previously obtained. We have successfully further isolated the echoes within the crystal. Through analysis, our scientists have pinpointed what appears to be an ordinary oceanic world.\n\nThis is an extremely important message. That mysterious ancient crystal seems to contain some kind of star map or coordinates. After patient and meticulous work, our research team has finally deciphered the information contained within—a location pointing to this oceanic world. While its surface appears calm and undisturbed, the information from the crystal suggests that its depths may conceal something of great significance. This world was chosen as the target of the crystal's star map for a reason."
      kuat_legacy.104.1.desc:"Locate this world."
      kuat_legacy.104.2.desc:"§EStage One: Beneath the Depths§!"
      kuat_legacy.104.a:"The core of this oceanic world is unexpectedly regular in structure, unlike anything formed naturally. Our scans revealed no other anomalies, but scientist [leader.GetName] has requested additional time for deeper exploration.\n\nThis is a momentous discovery. The core structure of this oceanic world is unusually regular, strongly suggesting it may be the result of artificial modification. While its surface appears calm and undisturbed, its interior hides incredible secrets.\n\nAlthough no other anomalies were detected, this alone is a major finding. [leader.GetName] deserves ample time to explore this world further and uncover the cause and purpose behind the core's unusual structure."
      kuat_legacy.104.a.res:"Authorization granted."
      kuat_legacy.104.b:"§EStage Two: The Hidden Structure§!"
      kuat_legacy.104.b.res:"The planet's core is hollow! Within it lies an advanced architectural complex—undoubtedly the remnants of a civilization with highly developed technology. The data we previously detected from the core was likely a false signal generated by the facility itself as a countermeasure against detection. Scientist [leader.GetName]'s team is now prepared to enter the core.\n\nAccording to reports transmitted by our research team after successfully entering the facility, this ancient and vast structure remains in a state of silence. No signals can be detected here, and the facility does not respond to any external transmissions, presenting some challenges to our investigation."
      kuat_legacy.104.c:"Such an advanced technique—proceed with caution."

      kuat_legacy.104.d:"Scientist [leader.GetName] cut into what appeared to be a doorway, inadvertently damaging part of the facility's structure, which restored power to certain internal systems. Fortunately, no dangerous situations arose, and our research team was able to locate the path to the control unit more easily.\n\nHowever, the subsequent report we received was deeply disappointing. Although our scientists successfully hacked into the control unit, they found no stored data—every trace of information regarding the builders of this facility had been deliberately erased. Our scientists believe this place must have been constructed by the same people responsible for the previous shelters, but it seems they were fleeing from something..."
      kuat_legacy.104.d.res:"Disturbing."
      kuat_legacy.104.e:"§EStage Four: Collapse§!"
      kuat_legacy.104.e.res:"We sent the disassembled device back to the research vessel above the planet, but the research team was shocked to discover that the structure within the planet had been continuously emitting a signal all along. Due to the anti-scanning systems, we had mistaken it for meaningless wave interference.\n\nScientist [leader.GetName] planned to re-enter the facility in search of clues, but suddenly, a violent explosion erupted from within the planet. The entire world collapsed from the inside out, and the underwater ruins were reduced to dust. Fortunately, our personnel successfully intercepted the signal—it may be our final clue."

      kuat_legacy.104.h:"Our researchers are ready to begin decryption. It is time to decode the intercepted signal.\n\nPreliminary analysis suggests the signal is connected to ancient ruins we discovered on a certain planet. It may carry a message from a lost civilization. If successfully deciphered, we may be able to reconstruct the true image of this forgotten civilization.\n\nThe time has come. It is time to lift the veil."
      kuat_legacy.104.h.res:"Decrypt as soon as possible."
      kuat_legacy.104.i:"Analysis Complete"
      kuat_legacy.104.i.res:"We have successfully deciphered this mysterious signal. Based on its pattern of variation, our researchers quickly pinpointed its origin. Our research team recommends we conduct a full-scale investigation immediately."

      kuat_legacy.104.j.res:0 "Based on our decoding and analysis of the crystal's data signal frequency, we have successfully obtained a star system coordinate."
      kuat_legacy.104.k:0 "How can this shield be removed?"
      kuat_legacy.104.k.res:0 "That civilization has achieved a level of research in the field of shielding that no other civilization can match, and this is merely a simplified version of the shields commonly used by that civilization. We have also mastered this technology, and are more than willing to provide it to you, as long as you are willing to pay a certain price."

      kuat_legacy.104.l:0 "What lies within that anomaly sealed by subspace energy?"
      kuat_legacy.104.l.res:0 "Subspace energy? So you've discovered it after all. That place was once the fleet support center of the Endordia Empire. Later, during the empire's defeat, it was taken over by desperate resistance forces who gathered the energy of subspace engines together and attempted to detonate the entire galaxy's subspace energy to seal the entire system.\n\nIt's quite surprising that it's already nearly failing after only four millennia. Perhaps there are still surviving Endordians inside. If you wish to restore access to this system, transmit your data to us and pay the price you must, and we will soon provide you with answers."

      kuat_legacy.117.title:0 "Abyssal Anchor"
      kuat_legacy.117.desc:0 "Our science ships have discovered a mysterious ancient shielded planet in $Name_F_1$. All attempts to penetrate the surface of the shielded planet have failed. According to reports from the research department, this shield may be related to an unknown precursor civilization.\n\nSince we do not yet know what lies beneath the shield, our research team recommends temporarily taking no action regarding this shielded planet. Perhaps the Abyssal Anchor at the center of the system will provide answers to some of the mysteries surrounding this shielded planet."
      kuat_legacy.117.a:0 "We're solving this problem again."
      kuat_legacy.118.title:0 "Technological Breakthrough"
      kuat_legacy.118.desc:0 "Through knowledge obtained from the descendants, our research team has gradually come to understand the basic theory behind the shield of the shielded planet in $Name_F_1$. Although this is only the tip of the iceberg of this advanced shield system, it is already sufficient for us to remove the shield covering this planet.\n\nHowever, removing the shield will still require some time."
      kuat_legacy.118.a:0 "Hurry up!"
      kuat_legacy.119.title:0 "Technological Breakthrough"
      kuat_legacy.119.desc:0 "We have acquired this powerful shield defense system and completed the adaptation work for our ships. However, due to the fact that this shield is still far too advanced for our current technological level, and we lack the necessary isotope-5, even with the theoretical knowledge, we are still unable to fully replicate the shield's functionality. But we are not without gains. These shield defense systems will now help maintain our fleet's combat efficiency.\n\nWe are now capable of removing the shield from the shielded planet in $Name_F_1$."
      kuat_legacy.119.a:0 "Upon arrival, our research personnel immediately began their work. After days and nights of relentless effort, we finally unlocked the door's security system this morning and cleared a path into the facility."
      kuat_legacy.120.title:0 "Shield Removal"
      kuat_legacy.120.desc:0 "With the help of knowledge provided by the descendants and using the Empire's most advanced equipment, our research team successfully removed the shield covering the shielded planet in $Name_F_1$. Just as the researchers excitedly prepared to scan the planet's surface beneath the shield, two unidentified ships were suddenly detected launching from the planet's surface by the science ships still on standby in planetary orbit. It seems the removal of the shield awakened these long-dormant ghosts. We have never seen such ships before; these vessels are structurally intact and clearly feature modular design.\n\nFor identification purposes, we have named the two ships: 'The Chapel (St Nicolas Abbey)' and 'The Golden Chapel (St Mark's Basilica).' As we attempt to establish contact through their communication channels and mobilize local system defense forces in preparation for any possible reaction, the two ships suddenly activated their jump drives and vanished before the researchers' eyes. Since we are unable to trace their jump destination coordinates, we can only remain vigilant for any potential threats while continuing our exploration of the planet.\n\nDue to the extremely harsh environment of this planet, we must first complete some infrastructure construction before we can continue exploring the planet."
      kuat_legacy.120.a:0 "Time to colonize this planet."

      kuat_lagacy:"§EStrange Signal§!"
      Kuat_structure:"The Imperial Research Department has submitted a report to us, clearly indicating that various monitoring stations within the Empire's territory have all received strange tachyon signals. These signals can be confirmed to originate from certain ruins of civilizations that possess some exploration value. It appears that these civilizations were all destroyed by the current most powerful force in the galaxy, “$Name_kuat$”, and that $Name_kuat$ is deliberately concealing everything. All of this seems highly unnatural, and we should begin a deeper investigation into these matters."

      kuat_legacy.3.desc:"After the Imperial science ship slowly landed on the planet's surface, [leader.GetName] led her researchers in setting up the camp and conducting routine safety checks when they discovered something unnatural about the planet. The planetary ecosystem here is unusually favorable, yet there are no large animal species present, which may suggest that the environment was artificially modified. The planet's magnetic field and gravity form a unique resonance pattern unlike any other planet, continuously emitting a special tachyon signal. [leader.GetName] has decided to lead her research team in conducting a full investigation of the planet.\n\nThe planetary survey indicates that this world was not originally a habitable planet with a good ecosystem; something must have happened to transform it. This may be related to the resonance pattern of the tachyon signal caused by the unusual gravitational fluctuations. [leader.GetName] has already begun searching for the source of the tachyon signal."
      kuat_legacy.3.a:"What exactly is the Eternal Fleet?"
      kuat_legacy.4.title:"§EPhase Two: Ancient Structures§!"
      kuat_legacy.4.desc:"This planet's ecological system is in excellent condition, suitable for habitation by any species, but when [leader.GetName] scanned the planet's surface, she discovered unnatural stone-like structures among the mountains. However, scans of the planet show no signs of life.\n\nAccording to our researchers' investigation, based on the feedback from our detectors, [leader.GetName] found that the signal becomes stronger the closer one gets to these ancient structures. After eliminating interference from the planet's unique magnetic field and other accidental factors, it is highly likely that the signal source is related to this lost architectural complex, which is very beneficial for our further investigation."
      kuat_legacy.4.a:"This must be thoroughly investigated."
      kuat_legacy.5.title:"§EPhase Three: Ancient Database§!"
      kuat_legacy.5.desc:"[leader.GetName] and her team used our advanced and precise instruments to approach and reach the area surrounding the stone structures. Based on the spatial distribution of the surrounding geographical information, [leader.GetName] believes these structures were built by intelligent beings. The scale of the architecture does not seem to support habitation by a large population, suggesting it may have been a camp established by a group of ancient exiles. Analysis of the surrounding environment shows that these structures were built a very long time ago, and their structural stability can no longer be guaranteed.\n\nAfter [leader.GetName] and her team stabilized the structures, they determined the location of the signal based on detector feedback. Our researchers are certain that the signal originates from a tower structure at the center of the ancient complex — faintly visible atop the spire is a glowing crystal.\n\nHowever, as [leader.GetName] approached, the gravity in the area changed. It seems the builders of the ruins simulated planetary gravity here for experimentation, and our research team was unable to directly remove the crystal.\n\nAlthough we were unable to retrieve the gravity crystal directly, [leader.GetName] was not without success. We found two architectural blueprints and one digitized planetary design plan within the database. Nothing else was recovered. It is now certain that these ancient experimental data may help us uncover the secret of this crystal's existence."
      kuat_legacy.5.a:"We should uncover the secrets here."
      kuat_legacy.6.title:"§EFinal Phase: Retrieve the Mysterious Crystal§!"
      kuat_legacy.6.desc:"After [leader.GetName] deciphered the mechanical devices within the ruins, she discovered some surprising reports that helped our researchers shut down the gravity reaction device within the facility.\n\n[leader.GetName] used the tachyon signal reaction of the gravity device within the structure to successfully deactivate the special resonance-guided gravity system. After the gravity systems were shut down, our research team easily removed the crystal. What puzzled us was that after the crystal was removed, [leader.GetName] resonated with it, allowing her to witness echoes of the past. Although brief, this information was extremely valuable to us.\n\nAccording to [leader.GetName]'s report, the resonance revealed the final moments of the prosperous and powerful homeworld of the facility's builders:\n\nIn the endless void of space, a massive fleet of Star Destroyers from $Name_kuat$ gathered. These ships easily tore through the planet's defenses. After their relentless bombardment, nearly no intact terrain remained on the entire planet."

      Kuat_structure_2:"The atmosphere of this gas giant is extremely unstable, which is highly detrimental to our research.\n\nOur probes have finally entered the atmosphere of this gas giant to begin various observations and sampling. However, as soon as they entered the atmosphere, the probes frequently encountered intense air currents and electromagnetic disturbances, causing all systems to fail and losing contact with the outside. When the probes reestablished contact, everything seemed to return to normal, but instrument records showed that during the brief loss of signal, various internal elements of the atmosphere underwent drastic changes, completely beyond our expectations.\n\nTherefore, we should conduct a deeper investigation into this gas giant!"
      kuat_legacy.7.title:"Open the cryopod at all costs."
      kuat_legacy.7.desc:"[leader.GetName]'s research team has begun gradually advancing the investigation into the crystal clues obtained from the ancient database.\n\n'Why is this crystal from the ruins capable of storing echoes of past memories?' The research team has developed a deep interest in this question. This crystal appears to possess some form of artificially designed information storage and regeneration function, capable of recording and replaying everything that occurs in its surrounding environment. In fact, the crystal's surface is covered with extremely fine circuits and nodes, which may be some kind of ultra-high-density information processing and recording system. Deciphering the mechanisms of this system may allow us to understand the peak of this ancient civilization's technology.\n\n'And where did the fleet seen in the memory echoes come from? Who were the original inhabitants of this planet?' These are the key targets for the team's upcoming exploration. The origin of that fleet remains a mystery, but they possessed weapons powerful enough to destroy an entire planet, indicating they must have been an advanced alien civilization. The builders of this planet are equally mysterious; only by continuing to decipher the database and the crystal's memories may we uncover their true identities.\n\nClearly, the research still has a long way to go. Let us wait and see."

      kuat_legacy.8.title:"Legacy"
      kuat_legacy.8.desc:"After [leader.GetName]'s tireless research day and night, we are now beginning to glimpse the secrets of this crystal.\n\nThis is a tool that transmits information to those who come into contact with it through a substance known as the Force. This Force seems to exist in some dimension of the universe, possessing the ability to convey various types of information and visual imagery. By resonating with the crystal, the research team can witness various events and information captured and recorded by the Force.\n\nHowever, the echoes from the crystal still do not reveal the origin of that fleet. This may mean that the crystal was not active when the fleet attacked the planet, and thus was unable to record the event.\n\nNonetheless, the crystal has shown us an ordinary gas giant, pointing us toward our next destination. Is this gas giant related to the creators of the crystal? Does it also contain similar information storage devices that may answer more of the questions we have?"

Yet we have never discovered a hidden star region in that area before — it's as if it suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Perhaps our detectors were mistaken, which is why we failed to detect this star region. We have already confirmed the coordinates of one relatively stable star system within it."

      kuat_legacy.11.a:"Yes, very strange indeed. This star system seems to have truly appeared out of nowhere. We are currently using probes to collect remote data from this system. The data coming back indicates that this star system was moved to its current location by some external force and has been hiding under our very noses for tens of thousands of years. However, this data still fails to solve the mystery of this star system. What’s more, we discovered that this star system bears a striking resemblance to the previously discovered $Name_A_1$ system.

Through generations of effort, they built a prosperous interstellar civilization — a republic of their own. But the republic did not last long. A political upheaval erupted in its capital, an event that transformed the republic into an empire. From there, they began their expansion and quickly occupied most of their star region, eventually making contact with foreign powers already entrenched in the area.\n\nAfter witnessing the power of these foreign forces, they became their proxy, exporting natural resources and manpower in exchange for military and technological support. However, when the Emperor made contact with another foreign power, the Empire began secretly infiltrating the original foreign force, eventually leading to a war that utterly destroyed the Empire.\n\nFortunately, the intervention of another foreign power quelled the military conflict and preserved a remnant of the civilization.

However, due to their lack of connection to the Force, they held less advantage compared to the $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ faction within the Imperial Warlord Coalition.\n\nTo compete for influence and control within the parliament and the imperial warlord government, they launched research operations under the guise of eliminating the Eternal Fleet, attempting to master its technology. Unfortunately, their research efforts met resistance when they encountered multiple different civilizations. As for their future — you shall be the witness to it all.\n\nThis is all we can tell you.

After the collapse of the Infinite Empire, they passed through many hands, eventually helping the Galactic Emperor maintain order in a crumbling galaxy. Unfortunately, after the Emperor's death, the Eternal Fleet lost control and initiated their protocol — the extermination of all discovered civilized worlds.\n\nThere are many terms here you may not yet understand.

Experiments conducted by our researchers on samples revealed that this warship could interfere with enemy weapons to some extent, preventing them from penetrating the shields and armor of friendly fleets. However, this technological advancement came too late—the warships never became the salvation the Endodia Empire desperately needed. Their frontline collapsed before the research could bear fruit, and these ships were still in the testing phase when the Endodia Empire fell, with all their research facilities seized and ultimately destroyed by $Name_kuat$.\n\nOverall, our researchers have uncovered part of the truth, but if we wish to understand the reasons behind this war, we must continue our investigation."

      kuat_legacy.65.a:"Our research on $misc_system_desc_3$ has now concluded, and so far our researchers have discovered a wealth of valuable information.\n\nFirstly, the information left behind in the $misc_system_desc_3$ facility is clearer than that found in previous sites. Our researchers, after sampling and analyzing the wreckage of ships and mechanical remains within the ruins, found that only a portion of these remains could be traced back to their manufacturing origins. By comparing these findings with evacuation footage recovered from the facility, our researchers identified some unique symbols belonging to this civilization—symbols that appear to be similar to written language. When compared with relevant data documents found among the wreckage, these symbols translated to 'Central Military Equipment Manufacturing Plant of the Endodia Empire.'\n\nSecondly, existing records and technical information left behind indicate that the Endodia Empire was technologically more advanced than our current level. However, the surviving footage and the battlefield ruins within the $misc_system_desc_3$ facility indicate that the Endodia Empire was already powerless to resist at this point. In fact, they could no longer even protect their own people. The remnants of the Endodia fleet and survivors evacuated to a region they referred to as $misc_system_desc_4$.\n\nAlthough the information we have obtained so far remains limited, our researchers believe we are one step closer to uncovering the truth. Now, we must continue our investigation."

It was unquestionably the heart of the Endodia Empire. Scans of the system by our researchers revealed that, compared to previous facility regions, this system contains significantly larger amounts of ship wreckage. It appears that the largest battle of the war between the Endodia Empire and their enemy took place in $misc_system_desc_4$. Based on estimates, the number of ships destroyed here exceeds the limits of what we understand as military power. Yet, after this brutal conflict, all that remains are scattered shipwrecks and damaged megastructures.\n\nAdditionally, among these wrecks, besides those belonging to the Endodia Empire and their enemy, there exists a new type of ship construction. These new designs have never been seen in previous facility regions or other systems, suggesting that a third force may have been involved in the battle within this system. Furthermore, our researchers discovered that some of the enemy ships bear a striking resemblance to ships currently sold and operated by $Name_kuat$, with several variations displaying similar designs but different insignias.\n\nIn summary, we can currently confirm the following:\n1. The Endodia Empire was indeed destroyed by $Name_kuat$.\n2. The destruction of the Endodia Empire by $Name_kuat$ appears to have been driven by a more powerful force.\n3. Another fleet of ships was actually involved in the battle.\n\nHowever, the situation remains murky, and we must continue our investigation."

Our former Emperor brought back a massive fully automated combat system from unknown regions of space, which he called the Eternal.\n\nFleets equipped with this automated combat system obeyed the Emperor completely, unless the Emperor perished. But reality is so amusing—despite possessing great power, one still cannot escape fate. During our empire's civil war, the Emperor and the throne were forever lost within the reactor energy of his warship, and chaos followed. It took the Imperial government a great deal of time to reorganize after its collapse, which caused the Eternal Fleet to fall out of Imperial control.\n\nAlthough the Empire can no longer control the Eternal Fleet, to us, these remnants are not significant enough for the new Imperial government to take seriously. We have already fully mastered the technology of the Eternal Fleet, so their existence no longer holds any value. These rogue Eternal Fleets are merely an annoying farce to us and to the Empire, but for you, they are a catastrophe.

Though they initially succeeded in resisting the influence of the Void, they eventually fell by their own hands.\n\nIn the end, they were nothing more than crabs in a basket—only focused on fighting among themselves, never noticing the true threat.

After the destruction of the ancient civilization, we established outposts and supply stations here. In exchange for our protection, the natives were required to pay for our supplies. It was a fair trade, after all, for even life itself is a gift granted by the strong.\n\nUnfortunately, the game of power and desire was played again, once more blinding their eyes and making them forget their place. The Endodia Empire shamelessly launched an unprovoked invasion against us. Although they were clearly seeking their own destruction, our merciful council still granted them pity—the fire of Endodia was allowed to endure.\n\nAs I said earlier, what has been done before shall be done again. This sector will always give rise to new challengers. We have grown weary of this tiresome game, so we have decided to stage a grand performance, and you have helped us complete the final preparations for this grand finale.\n\nWe approve of you becoming the opening fireworks of this performance. You shall become the fertilizer and legacy for future civilizations, offering your insignificant lives for the rebirth of this sector."

With the Eternal Fleet already eliminated in other sectors, our progress has caused dissatisfaction within the Imperial government—and the cause of all this is you, the lowly native races. We once selected agents here to help us set up signal relays.\n\nThe initial plan went smoothly—three relay stations were successfully placed around this sector. But the foolish Endodia hindered everything, giving the Eternal Fleet a chance to survive and causing us to lose face in the Imperial Senate. Endodia must be held accountable for their actions, which is why their nation was destroyed. Unlike you, the ungrateful inferior races, even when they challenged our authority, Endodia was still allowed to preserve its flame.\n\nAlthough fools always try to hinder our plans, how can the strength of mayflies shake a towering tree? According to plan, we will set up three relay stations and activate them when you challenge our authority. The Eternal Fleet in this sector will be drawn to the signal and converge here, forcing you into direct conflict with them.\n\nWhen the dust settles, we shall use the tachyon signal magnetic field signature generated by the relay stations to lock onto this sector from our base and erase this entire sector along with the tiresome Eternal Fleet.\n\nDance freely, for this fireworks display is about to shine, and you may still enjoy your final moments of revelry."

As you have seen, you have successfully defeated and destroyed all of the Eternal Fleets in this galactic region, which genuinely surprised us. You bear some resemblance to the ancient Endordia Empire—you are like those favored by the gods, effortlessly acquiring powerful weapons and advanced technology, no matter how rare or terrifying these abilities may be, even capable of making your enemies vanish without warning. Even the Eternal Fleets were nothing more than scrap metal and dust before you.\n\nBut the Eternal Fleets, like us, do not belong to this domain. We came into being because of the Eternal, and we will only fade away because of it. We do not fully understand the origins of the Eternal Fleets ourselves. Our former emperor brought back a massive fully automated combat system from unknown regions of space, which he called the Eternal. Fleets equipped with this fully automated combat system obeyed the emperor completely, unless the emperor himself perished.\n\nDespite possessing great power, he could not escape the fate that awaited him. During our empire's civil war, the emperor and the throne vanished forever into the energy of the reactor aboard his warship, and chaos began from there.\n\nAlthough the empire could no longer control the Eternal Fleets after the government collapsed, these things were no longer significant enough for the new imperial government to take seriously. We had already fully mastered the technology of the Eternal Fleets, so their existence no longer held any value. These rogue Eternal Fleets are nothing more than a tiresome farce to us and the empire, but to you, they were a disaster. These fleets, composed of ancient intelligent systems from Iokas, must have their troubles ended—and you will be the key personnel to bring an end to this farce of the old era."

Are the past, present, and future not unified in a cycle?\n\nThis region of space was once ruled by an ancient civilization composed of many native species. They, like you modern god-favored beings, possessed a glorious civilization, fleets that darkened the skies, and technologies powerful enough to destroy themselves. However, they were blinded by the power they wielded and researched something called the 'Everspace'—these irrational desires ultimately brought about their destruction.\n\nIn the end, it was nothing more than a basket of crabs—fighting amongst themselves without ever noticing the true threat. The shadow of the Eternal Fleets loomed over this place until we brought light, safety, and prosperity to the entire galaxy. After the destruction of the ancient civilization, we established outposts and supply stations here. In exchange for our protection, the natives were required to pay for our supplies.\n\nIt was a fair trade, after all, for even life itself is a gift from the strong. Unfortunately, the game of power and desire was played again, once more blinding their eyes and making them forget their place. The Endordia Empire launched a shameless invasion against us, and although they were clearly seeking their own destruction, our merciful council still granted them mercy—the spark of Endordia was allowed to survive.\n\nAs I said earlier, what has been done will be done again. This region will always produce challengers. We have grown tired of this tiresome game, so we planned a grand performance. But you succeeded in defeating part of our fleet and resolving the threat of the Eternal Fleets in this region. We believe all of this is temporary—life continues, the cycle continues.

With the Eternal Fleets already eliminated in other regions, our slow progress has caused dissatisfaction within the imperial government, and the cause of all this is none other than the lowly natives of this domain.\n\nWe once selected proxies here to set up signal relays for us. The initial phase of the plan went smoothly, with three relay stations successfully placed around this region. But the foolish Endordia hindered everything. They allowed the Eternal Fleets to cling to survival and brought us shame in the imperial court. Endordia must be held accountable for their actions, which is why their nation was destroyed. Unlike you ungrateful inferior races, we showed mercy even when they challenged our authority, allowing the spark of Endordia to survive.\n\nAlthough fools always try to hinder our plans, how can the strength of mayflies shake a towering tree? As planned, we would set up three relay stations and activate them when you challenged our authority. The Eternal Fleets in this region would be drawn by the signal and gather here, forcing you into direct conflict with them.\n\nOnce the dust settled, we would use the tachyon signal magnetic field characteristics generated by the relays to lock our base onto this region of space, then erase this entire sector along with the boring Eternal Fleets.\n\nIt's just a pity—we failed, and you succeeded."

This mechanic grants your mod's ships an intense daily healing of 3-9 days, depending on the Flagship type, when facing non-mod units.\n\nWhen facing Eternal Empire and $Name_kuat$ fleets, the Flagship mechanic grants your fleet the ability to resist damage suppression from Eternal fleets, allowing your fleet to deal 1%-75% damage output, and all mod ships will remain under protection until the Flagship is destroyed (but cannot resist event kills or instant high damage). Non-mod units receive a 100% cumulative bonus over the duration and a 100% total damage bonus for the corresponding time.\n\nSupport Mechanic: Support ships will serve as assistants to the Flagship in the fleet, increasing the total bonus of the Flagship by 10-25%. Usually, a 1+2 composition is used, including support Flagships such as §YBattlemaster$X308_Balletor$, Titan-class$X308_Balletor$, and Tyrant-class$X308_Balletor$.§!"

This part grants factions in this mod, including the Eternal Empire series, $Name_kuat$ series, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ series, and Infinite Empire series, resistance to any high-tier aura suppression effects, meaning they are unaffected by aura modifiers.\n\nPart II: Mechanic Safeguard. This part affects the player and is used by the Eternal Empire series, Infinite Empire series, $Name_kuat$ series, and Watcher series. The Eternal Empire series is the most important part of this mod, and this mechanic ensures the full operation of the Flagship system and the combat effectiveness of the Eternal fleets.\n\nFinally, the Supply Zone serves to enhance Flagship effects and weaken the Dynamic Adjustment. This mechanic is mainly generated by Eternal Fortresses and Colossus Fortresses (encouraging home defense operations). This mechanic has the following effects:\n1. Supply Zones increase the supply limit of systems within their range. Within the supply limit, Super Flagships gain a 600% cyclic bonus in combat, 1+2 Flagships gain 300%, and single Flagships gain 100%. Beyond the limit, output is reduced to the base Flagship level.\n2. Supply Zones provide Flagship fleets with combat energy charges. Once charged, Flagships can support 4 battles outside the Supply Zone, each reducing the cyclic bonus by 25%. They will be recharged within 60 days upon returning to the Supply Zone."

As a result, the star was transformed into a white hole.\n\nRegarding the ancient remains, their examination has left our scientific team in disbelief. These bodies appear to be stitched together from multiple different organisms, with different DNA in different body parts, yet their exterior appears seamless. Autopsy results confirm the findings—the skeletal and other internal components of their bodies share no commonalities. This abnormality has led our scientific team to believe these remains may be defective or discarded products of some artificial life project. We have decided to search for more valuable information."

This architectural style is completely contrary to modern design—mysterious and ancient, evoking a deeply oppressive and heavy atmosphere.\n\nYet, the ear-splitting crashing sounds originate from above the dome. Thick, massive silver-gray chains pierce through the dome, extending outward and firmly anchoring it in place. The chains move slowly, shifting along with the dome’s expansion, as if possessing their own life. Each link is engraved with complex and strange patterns, twisting and rotating as if imbued with a soul.\n\nThey move along specific paths, eventually converging at the dome’s core.

    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.19.2.desc:0 "The Star Gods constructed a massive Dyson array around the star Caroline in this region of space. Caroline was covered by a massive grid, forming a Dyson sphere network. This network was linked by energy collectors and storage facilities. As for the civilization that used it, no one knows them, no one has seen them. They were ancient even to $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$. The only thing we know is that the Star Gods were masters of spatial control and wormhole technology in the time domain. They used their facilities to twist the laws of space-time, creating the space known as Aenoix, which exists between subspace and reality.\n\n$Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$, as vassals of the Star Gods, specialized in virtual reality, neural interface technology, and cryogenic science. They expanded their civilization into our galaxy through a wormhole in the 'No Return' system, establishing a massive fortress in what is now the Void Exclusion Zone, and constructing a colossal observatory. However, space-time technology carried grave risks. The isolated Aenoix space was rejected by both subspace and reality. The Star Gods' technology triggered severe wormhole collapses. As time and space twisted, the Star Gods completely collapsed, and their colonies vanished without a trace. No one knows exactly what happened, but their presence in the galaxy was eventually hidden by time within the Void of the 'God's Frontier'.\n\nDuring that event, $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$ survived by placing their entire civilization aboard massive arks, drifting through the cosmos at just above light speed. Thus, most of their species remained in a virtual reality environment in suspended animation. This environment was called the 'Construct,' and from that point onward, they began calling themselves the 'Inhdouani.'\n\nThe Construct used simulated time dilation, allowing their civilization to develop rapidly after the crisis, surpassing anything imaginable in the physical world. Soon, the limitations of reality could no longer constrain this new civilization."
    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.19.3.desc:0 "§EReport II: Suspended Life§!"
    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.19.4.desc:0 "Because they inherited the Star Gods' technological path, but it was incomplete, they fell into this trap. The technology of suspended life gave rise to a conflict between self-awareness and physical development, leading to consciousness erosion. To protect the safety of their consciousness and ensure they still existed in reality, the Inhdouani established an early law known as the 'One Mind, One Body Law.' Simply put, if a person had a consciousness within the Construct, there had to be a corresponding physical body in reality. This served two purposes: first, it ensured that everything within the Construct had once been a fellow Inhdouani, but the Construct itself was eventually modified to use the brains of connected individuals as part of its computational system. Therefore, if the physical body was removed, part of the Construct would be damaged, potentially taking part of the Construct with it.\n\nThese syndromes were not truly diseases in the conventional sense, but rather genetic design flaws. This caused all Inhdouani to eventually fall into depression, madness, and death given enough time. Ultimately, the Inhdouani turned to those living within the Construct, seeking a cure for the disease. The only solution was to join the Construct and enter suspended life alongside them. This period of history is known as the 'Isolation Days.' No one, not even the surviving Inhdouani, seems to fully understand what happened during those days."

The remaining Inhdouani continued to struggle in other regions of Aenoix, fighting against the disease while secretly observing the young empires that emerged from the Dark Age.\n\nUltimately, the expansion of modern nations combined with the effects of the disease forced the Inhdouani Empire to retreat further and further from our galaxy. However, as one empire fell, another would rise.\n\nAt this time, the Inhdouani were in a period of strife. Deep within Aenoix, some Inhdouani driven mad by genetic disease chose to fall into corruption. They used forbidden technologies on themselves, violating the One Mind, One Body Law. Over time, these mad Inhdouani came to be known as '$Name_Kuat_Contractor$.' At the moment they abandoned the law, they were already dead, but their bodies were kept alive through forbidden technologies. By violating the One Mind, One Body Law, their very existence was a great offense to the living."

When $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$ transferred their consciousness between Constructs, $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ hitched a ride, inserting themselves into $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$'s Constructs. From that point on, nearly all $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$ felt a persistent, dark whispering in their minds.\n\n$Name_Kuat_Contractor$ quickly seized control of parts of the consciousness, forcing them to open the assembly halls of $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$, seizing the suspended bodies of $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$. They imprisoned and enslaved the resisting $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$, injecting their consciousness into machines while their physical bodies were stolen by $Name_Kuat_Contractor$.\n\nThe $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ who gained freedom within the Construct built massive hives and launched large-scale attacks on $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$'s enclaves. From the data we obtained from $Name_Kuat_DeD_Contractor$, $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ has already gained access to the Dead Zone of the Abyss. They are harassing a powerful force located in the Dead Zone of the Abyss, and that force seems to regard $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ as the heir to the Second Inhdouani Empire, unaware that $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ are artificial creations.\n\nThis ancient war has now spread into modern times. At this point, something unexpected happened to $Name_Kuat_Contractor$—the stars within the domain of Vela in Aenoix were linked together by the Star Gods through the construction of a Dyson swarm around each star, using this energy to create rifts in reality and static portals to traverse them.\n\nCaroline Star, due to the destruction of its isotope-5 storage facilities, released explosive energy through the network into the stars, damaging the surrounding Dyson lattice. Years later, the star exploded, causing a much larger explosion deep within Aenoix. This event destroyed all hyperspace routes and wormholes in Aenoix, trapping $Name_Kuat_Contractor$ within Aenoix, unable to escape. This event became known as the 'Caroline Star' incident."

Although it may take a very long time before the star ultimately collapses into the black hole's singularity, the effects of near-black hole orbit have already begun to manifest, with the singularity generating intense and unstable gravitational tides.\n\nSince the star is located at the outer edge of the black hole's accretion disk, fluctuations in cloud mass density further exacerbate this instability. Therefore, the stellar environment in this region is extremely harsh, which may also be the reason why '$Name_G_1$' has suddenly reappeared after countless ages of silence.\n\n§GThe Abyss Node located in $Name_G_1$ has fallen from the Abyss, and it is precisely this node that allows the reconstruction of Abyssal technology information.

Each of their warships' turrets employs warp technology, channeling the energy of the ship's warp core through an isotope-5 matrix into the warp accelerator. The resulting vortex field output is wound within a prism and then released radially from the core as a particle beam, which is directed into an anti-polarized compression acceleration field. These subatomic particles violently collide within the accelerator, undergoing critical heating and combining into a dense quark-gluon plasma superfluid pool. Through the prism effect, this energy is redirected outward, forming a narrow, spiral-shaped beam of luminous exotic matter—a spear of light capable of piercing targets with immense force. Moreover, these turrets operate independently, floating on the hull via special electromagnetic fields, eliminating the resistance of turret rotation and allowing them to hit even the fastest-moving targets orbiting the ship. Combined with cryogenic and thermal management technologies, rapid firing becomes possible. This may be the most efficient starship weapon design we have ever encountered.\n\nSimilar technologies are also widely applied in other modules of the ships, which explains why even our most advanced ships, despite numerical superiority, cannot achieve favorable combat exchange ratios when facing these technological monsters.

    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.20.A.desc:0 "We have completed $kuat_fallen_mission_reaction_17_project$. During the research process, our scientists discovered $kuat_fallen_mission_reaction_17.poject_desc$\n\nAt this point, we have completed all projects. We can now confirm that $Name_kuat$ is gathering this information for use against the Eternal Fleet. Additionally, the Eternal Fleet's technology is highly complex. Multiple factions have already sought after this technological information. We should consider how to handle it."
    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.20.B.desc:0 "From the basic structure of this weapon turret, its internal first-level structure is quite similar to our existing ultraviolet laser weapons, but the energy levels are far higher. However, other components are more complex. The high-energy laser beam generated at the upper level is guided through a stream of gas we currently cannot understand.\n\nThen, through some unknown reaction, a beam of high-density plasma is emitted."
    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.20.C.desc:0 "This is an extremely rare substance, a radioactive isotope of a fuel called Illerium. Preliminary studies of the samples provided by $Name_kuat$ indicate that this material has powerful warping effects on gravitational and electromagnetic fields. It is relatively stable under normal conditions, but under specific conditions, particle bombardment can release massive amounts of energy.\n\nOur research department speculates that just one microgram of this isotope could generate enough power to operate a high-performance data pad for an entire century."
    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.20.D.desc:0 "This weapon is directly connected to the ship's reactor core by design, appearing to be an energy-intensive weapon—our reactors are completely incapable of supporting its consumption. It resembles a ship-mounted weapon we once encountered, but this weapon's excitation laser continuously supplies power over a period of time, generating more and longer high-energy particle beams. These beams then pass through an intricately designed focusing device and particle acceleration track, resulting in even greater destructive power. It is speculated that its power is sufficient to destroy any known ship in a single strike.\n\nAccording to the perception of Force-sensitive individuals among us, the focusing device likely contains large kyber crystals."

    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.20.A:0 "$Name_kuat$ has given us a computational network we have never seen before, requesting that we study it and deliver our findings back to them. It uses advanced signal transmission and reception equipment to turn every ship in a fleet into a computing node, and even multiple node clusters across multiple fleets can form a new high-level computing network.\n\nThis advanced distributed computing architecture can support immense computational and storage demands. What kind of system would require such immense computing power remains unknown to us. We have attempted further reverse engineering, but it is clear that our current technology and hardware are entirely incapable of replicating this system."
    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.20.A.respon:0 "This system is similar to the special interference system used by $Name_kuat$, but appears to be more powerful in certain aspects. It employs some special means to enhance shield and armor efficiency, while also reducing enemy weapon power. However, $Name_kuat$'s Star Dreadnoughts can partially counteract its effects.\n\nThe Force-sensitive individuals among us have sensed that this technology seems to contain elements of the dark side of the Force, making it impossible for us to replicate."

    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.20.B:0 "Based on what we have discovered and some technical documents provided by $Name_kuat$, this should be a communications beacon component from a massive interstellar fortress. It emits tachyon signals for long-range communication, but requires some [error] to amplify the signal for intergalactic transmission.\n\nAdditionally, according to the documents, when error....error....station and the Eternal error....error....fleet are synchronized, it can project a support field capable of affecting an entire star system, ensuring that fleets within it cannot be destroyed."
    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.20.B.respon:0 "This is a reactor that generates power by annihilating a form of exotic fuel, creating a miniature star within the reaction chamber. Unlike conventional exotic matter reactors, this reactor directly consumes the fuel itself, whereas conventional versions extract exotic matter from higher dimensions through fuel decay, achieving higher efficiency and energy levels."

    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.20.C:0 "Unlike $Name_kuat$'s usual style, this ship is entirely black and shaped like a horizontal T, but with a crossbar at the front resembling a cross, and engines at the rear. Its main cannons are all mounted on the front crossbar, and the turrets are highly maneuverable. The propulsion system of this ship is highly advanced, significantly faster than ours, and equipped with a cloaking generator.\n\nIts shape and energy signature seem similar to some ships that once fought against the Nodocracy Empire. Perhaps what $Name_kuat$ has us studying is no ordinary thing..."
    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.20.C.respon:0 "Based on the documents handed over by $Name_kuat$ and some information we have uncovered... this may be a fleet command artificial intelligence designed and constructed by a superpower known as the Infinite Empire when it encountered some kind of plague, in an attempt to save its civilization. Allegedly, it sacrificed the life force of several species and planets to create this AI.\n\nAdditionally, according to archaeological records, the Infinite Empire was seemingly destroyed due to a rebellion by its own automated battle fleets. The truth is chilling... Could they be researching the same strange fleets that the Nodocracy Empire once fought against?"

    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.20.D:0 "This massive war fortress bears an uncanny resemblance to both our own war fortresses and certain facilities of $Name_kuat$, yet its subsystems and armaments appear significantly more powerful.\n\nHistorical records show that the Nodocracy Empire encountered extragalactic automated fleets in battle, and these fortresses appeared on the battlefield, providing support to the automated fleets. According to our research on the interstellar communication beacons, these fortresses would continuously provide fleet reinforcements during invasions unless three special facilities were deactivated. It seems $Name_kuat$ is having us research something far more ominous..."
    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.20.D.respon:0 "$Name_kuat$ has informed us that some of their new designs require more energy. Out of trust in us and a show of surface-level friendliness, they have chosen to hand over this energy regulation component for our study. Combining this with previous clues, we can roughly deduce what $Name_kuat$ is researching. However, now may not be the time to confront them directly.\n\nThis device is designed to optimize reactor output and conserve ship energy consumption. It seems they are researching this in preparation for using something extremely energy-intensive?"

    kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.21.desc:0 "Similar to $Name_kuat$'s Star Dreadnoughts, this ship serves as a fleet flagship and possesses some anti-jamming capabilities. However, unlike $Name_kuat$'s Super Star Destroyer design philosophy, this ship is equipped with only four of the previously studied superlasers, seemingly intended for long-range bombardment.\n\nFurthermore, Nodocracy's battle logs mention this type of ship appearing in combat, often forming part of an operational fleet alongside battlecruisers from the automated fleets. It seems clear what $Name_kuat$ is having us assist in researching..."

 tech_kuat_strange_shield_contractor_desc:0 "The Aegis Defense Deflection Matrix is less of a shield and more of a dual-purpose system, capable of both defense and offense, and is generally considered the standard shield and superweapon system used by Wanderer ships.\n\nFunctionally, the Aegis Defense Deflection Matrix is essentially a shield that can collect impact energy, and when the collected energy reaches its limit, it activates a massive directional warp lance: the system manipulates free molecules, radiating them into a generated counter-rotating field, accelerating them to a critical point, where they combine into quark-gluon plasma, then directing it outward toward the target.\n\nDue to the targeting requiring a charging process, we need to use Isotope-5 in the ship's energy core. Isotope-5 enables the shield energy to achieve focused redirection, allowing attacks on fast and difficult-to-aim-and-track targets."

 tech_kuat_strange_shield_contractor_1_desc:0 "By adjusting the intensity of the core field, it is possible to freely control both shield strength and weapon output, as the core field can directly penetrate the exterior of the hull, extending the effect of the shield generator.\n\nThe resulting shield can withstand and store additional energy and momentum from any attack—temporarily stored energy will far exceed the ship's structural tolerance. When the incoming attack reaches a critical state, the ship's core Isotope-5 will reverse the stored energy and direct it toward a target locked by the weapon system, focusing the field through manipulation by Isotope-5 onto a single point.\n\nThen, core particles will radiate toward this focal point, combining into quark-gluon plasma, and firing toward the target with unparalleled destructive power."
