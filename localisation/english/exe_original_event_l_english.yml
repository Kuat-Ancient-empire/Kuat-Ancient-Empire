They were attracted by $StarForge$, and they were completely led to destruction and darkness by $StarForge$. They are trying to break through these technical blockades and control all of this, but after all, all this is just a cloud, and only we can control this super fortress.

The Empire database cannot determine who created them, but the emperor controlled the throne and brought the eternal fleet to the empire. Due to the gap between the automatic system of the eternal fleet and its relatively backward weapons, the imperial military attaches great importance to the eternal fleet. In the subsequent technical upgrade and transformation of the Eternal Fleet, the military combined the powerful technology of the Empire and put the Eternal Fleet into operations against the rebels at that time. The results of the operations against the local warlords and rebels were remarkable, and they successfully defeated and destroyed the rebels. However, unfortunately, if the eternal fleet loses control of the throne’s owner, the eternal fleet will restore the original extinction system. They will destroy everything. In fact, due to the emperor’s and the military’s mistakes, the emperor will be ruined. Let the Eternal Fleet go out of control, and according to the database information, before the Eternal Fleet’s throne was destroyed by the rebels and the Eternal Fleet was completely out of control, we used its signal resonance to successfully re-control part of the Eternal Fleet, but there were still a large number of completely out of control.

The scientific research team hopes that the colonial government of §H[Root.GetName]§! can allocate resources to support our scientific research team’s peculiar database for research and investigation, and add some tachyon signal amplifiers in the ruins to help our scientific research team deal with this strange Tachon signal for research.\n\nUnfortunately, the work of transforming the peculiar database on §H[Root.GetName]§! is not easy, and the ancient tachyon signal transmitter in the center of the ruins will treat us The work caused serious interference, and our scientific research team needed more resources to find solutions."

Since the collapse of the Lakata Empire, the intelligent system of automatic maintenance and operation of the entire stellar furnace has gradually become independent, and the entire system has produced the resonance of the expanding dark force.

Under the temptation of the stellar furnace, they gradually walked towards the corroded abyss. During their exploration of the ruins, they discovered these peculiar database facilities. Very similar to their former facility in another galaxy where the Intergalactic Weapon Guardian is located. But they did not have the opportunity to investigate this part further. The explorers started to investigate the part of the ruins that could be known. They analyzed the magnetic resonance and tachyon signal frequencies in the ruins and found that these tachyon signal frequencies seemed to be the result of some kind of intelligent system. Resonance frequencies, which, although detectable, are extremely stable, and when the explorers found they could not interfere with the tachyon signals, lured by the furnace, they decided to cast these signals through the diagonal facility across the star The furnace keeps it running. \n\nBut like before, our trail was interrupted, maybe we should go to the next facility to find it."

Cruel, no one has won, and the stellar forge still stands in the center of the entire star field.

These signals gather and generate a peculiar magnetic resonance here. According to the investigation of our imperial database, the furnace's History is full of blood and war, and creators ultimately havetened their demise. \n\nOur scientific research team and council believe that we can use the stellar furnace to provide strong support for our fleet operations, and at the same time use its similar tachyon signals, we can try to activate the relay stations throughout the star field and outer space.
