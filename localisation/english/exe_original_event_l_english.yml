The Empire database cannot determine who created them, but the emperor controlled the throne and brought the eternal fleet to the empire. Due to the gap between the automatic system of the eternal fleet and its relatively backward weapons, the imperial military attaches great importance to the eternal fleet. In the subsequent technical upgrade and transformation of the Eternal Fleet, the military combined the powerful technology of the Empire and put the Eternal Fleet into operations against the rebels at that time. The results of the operations against the local warlords and rebels were remarkable, and they successfully defeated and destroyed the rebels. However, unfortunately, if the eternal fleet loses control of the throne’s owner, the eternal fleet will restore the original extinction system. They will destroy everything. In fact, due to the emperor’s and the military’s mistakes, the emperor will be ruined. Let the Eternal Fleet go out of control, and according to the database information, before the Eternal Fleet’s throne was destroyed by the rebels and the Eternal Fleet was completely out of control, we used its signal resonance to successfully re-control part of the Eternal Fleet, but there were still a large number of completely out of control. Fleets exist, these fleets must be eliminated, they will pose a threat to the empire.

According to the results of our current research, the Eternal Fleet can withstand almost any weapon attack, but that is done through an electronic suppression and defense system that we cannot design and manufacture for the time being, so we can be based on this system. Features For targeted operations, our §R powerful but limited §! Interstellar Dreadnoughts can reduce the influence of the eternal fleet to a certain extent.
