We have anticipated that we will be defeated by you. The Imperial Council has passed a resolution to abandon this area. We will no longer return to this galaxy after this attack. You natives will break away from the native status and become the new galactic shield. \n\nUnfortunately, the central control station of the Eternal Fleet has been destroyed in our civil war. They are out of control. We are unable to repair the central control station. Maybe you can repair it in the future. But now you are going to defend your galaxy. \n\nWe will tell you the weakness of the Eternal Fleet. In the next war, you need to build flagships with auxiliary ships to resist the war suppression of the Eternal Fleet. And it must be noted that the eternal fleet will endlessly attack any place where creatures exist. We have left all our technologies, and hope you can defend your galaxy. \n\nIt's time for you to become the shield of standing, never see you again."

 exe_return_invasion.38.desc:"The war has passed for some time. Our researchers have conducted more in-depth research on the Eternal Fleet. The researchers of the Imperial Academy of Sciences have produced a report on the Eternal Fleet based on an unknowing but attractive document. Fleet, ancient civilization, Endory Empire, Kuat Empire research report: §Y\n\nDear [root.GetRulerTitle], our war against the eternal fleet has passed for some time, our research on the eternal fleet In line with the prediction and what Kuat once said, the Eternal Fleet has been completely defeated by us. And with regard to the interpretation and identification of the Eternal Fleet, the Kuat Empire, the Endory Empire, and ancient civilizations, we have put together a more accurate 'historical record' through the various information left by the Kuat and Endory. \nThe Eternal Fleet and the Kuat Empire are not the aboriginals of this area, and the existence of the Eternal Fleet is the basis and reason why the Kuat Empire exists here. The Kuat Empire came from a civilization outside of the unknown star field. They were warlords and factions of a civilized regime from a star field unknown to us. According to the data we obtained from the Kuat database combined with the eternal shipwreck, the civilized regime to which Kuat belongs is undergoing a major change. The leader of the regime, the emperor, has an advanced intelligent combat system in his hands. Controlled super fleet, this combat system is operated under the emperor's instructions. However, in the process of change, the death of the emperor brought chaos and disintegration of the imperial regime. It also allowed the Eternal Fleet to restore their initialization agreement and destroy any creatures. The chaos caused by the Eternal Fleet was quickly calmed by them, and a large number of eternal fleets were flowing. Still running out of their control area. Due to the threat of the eternal fleet, after the reorganization of the empire, on the one hand, it organized battles against the rebels they called it, and on the other hand it sent a fleet to encircle and suppress, and Kuat discovered our star field precisely because of this. Kuat used our infighting, and through the emptiness of the galactic power brought about by the demise of ancient civilizations, he controlled almost all the resources of our star area and used them to support their encirclement and suppression of the eternal fleet and seek a more stable rule over our star area. Therefore, in order to maintain a stable and long-term rule of our star area, the Kuat Empire has supported one proxy after another trying to control our entire galaxy behind the scenes. They rarely appear in our eyes, but they will choose suitable agents. . So they chose the ancient Endory Empire as the puppet regime. However, the Endory Empire was not reconciled to become the puppet of the Kuat Empire. They tried to control everything that Kuat seized, so they chose to rebel against the Kuat Empire. . However, the Ndodia Empire failed, they paid a heavy price, and they nearly died. As a victorious nation, the Kuat Empire continued to hunt down Ndodia’s stubborn resistance while looking for new agents. Therefore, the Kuat people chose us. They tried to make us better as the new puppet regime of the Kuat Empire. To maintain their rule over the star field and support their battle against the Eternal Fleet. \n\nBut everything is broken. In order to destroy the Eternal Fleet and control our star field more quickly, Kuat has arranged a large number of signal relay station systems that are in line with the Eternal Fleet’s transmission and reception. They try to use the destruction of our galaxy to do it once and for all. Destroy and control the eternal fleet. And we will also be the victims of the Kuat Empire, but all these plans have been broken. Under the leadership of the great [root.GetRulerTitle], we not only defeated the Kuat Empire, but even destroyed the eternal fleet, and we have truly become the controller of this star field. \n\nToday, many celebrations took place across the country. People are expressing their excitement about the arrival of the new era and their expectations for the new era, as well as your praise of our empire§!\n\nDear [root.GetRulerTitle], our galactic era has begun!"
