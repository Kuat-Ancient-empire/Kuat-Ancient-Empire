It offers multiple benefits; while enhancing perception by interfacing with the occipital lobe, it also improves the brain's information processing capabilities by influencing the neocortex. When multiple implants form a neural implant network, they can achieve even higher performance."

The recordings within the Cloud City Refuge are filled with despair and wailing. Through analysis of the data, we can confirm that the builders of this facility were once an extremely powerful civilization. They encountered an enemy far stronger than themselves, and after losing the war, the civilization split into a faction seeking compromise and one of resistance. Their ultimate fate, however, remains to be investigated."
