Due to their extremely rare signal propagation pattern, our researchers speculate that it is some kind of alien civilization's signal wave. The research department recommends we investigate the source of these signals as soon as possible."

 ag_legacy_stroy.2.desc: "Our researchers have concluded their investigation on [root.from.planet.GetName]. During this investigation, our researchers successfully obtained more information. The recordings within the Cloud City Refuge are filled with despair and wailing. Through analysis of the data, we can confirm that the builders of this facility were once an extremely powerful civilization. They encountered an enemy far stronger than themselves, and after losing the war, the civilization split into factions—those who compromised and those who resisted. Their ultimate fate, however, remains unknown."

 ag_legacy_stroy.3.desc: "Our researchers have concluded their investigation on [root.from.planet.GetName]. Although the clues within this ruin are not obvious, our researchers have still managed to piece together some information. The Deep Sea Base originated from the resistance faction of the ruin's civilization. They established underwater weapon development and personnel training centers, attempting to fight back against the enemy that destroyed them."

The data storage devices within the refuge contain almost no valuable information, having been deliberately erased. Therefore, we have reason to believe the refuge was abandoned, and further investigation is required. Next, we must await further breakthroughs from our researchers."

We can confirm that the owner of this facility later issued an order for the population to evacuate the refuge and transfer large amounts of data storage equipment. Our researchers speculate that the builders, upon realizing resistance was hopeless, attempted to preserve their history and data within the facility, leaving behind the truth of their civilization for future generations."

According to what we know, the Infinite Empire was a vast power that ruled the galaxy tens of thousands of years ago, long before humanity's emergence. We can no longer imagine how prosperous and powerful it was, yet this mighty empire collapsed rapidly in a short period. This remote colony seems to have experienced a similar fate, but we have found no clues to reveal the cause of their destruction."
