After preliminary deciphering, we found that this batch of information involves a wide range of academic research by descendants, including astrophysics, quantum mechanics, bioengineering, history, theology and other strange subjects. \n\nBut what shocks us even more is that this batch of information also contains descriptions of a certain "corruption epidemic." According to the documents, we will be exposed to these infectious diseases due to the taboo act of sacrificing our lives, but believe that we will overcome this. \n\nIn addition, this batch of materials also mentions a large number of forces that are still unknown to us. We only understand the history of the Endodian Empire and the Kuat Empire and the grievances between them, but other forces are still in the fog. , we don’t know the specific information yet. \n\nThe Endodia Empire has collapsed, and the shadow is still hanging over the sky. Maybe we should stop and re-examine our future. Maybe, the Endodia Empire is right. \n\nIn general, this discovery has opened the door to a broader level, but the way forward is still shrouded in mystery. We will remain vigilant and protect what we have worked so hard for at all costs. \n\nI sincerely hope that our civilization can embark on our great journey under your wise leadership."

During this investigation, our researchers successfully established contact with the crystal and obtained some clues hidden behind the ruins. Those fleets that bombed the planet, we seem to Where have I seen it...\n\nBut no matter what, it is an important clue for us to uncover these unknown secrets.

 ag_legacy_stroy.2.desc: "Our researchers' investigation on [root.from.planet.GetName] has come to an end. During this investigation, our researchers successfully obtained more information. The images in the Cloud City shelter are full of despair and wailing. By sorting out the data, we can determine that the builders of the facility were once an extremely powerful civilization. They encountered an enemy far more powerful than them. After the defeat of the war, the builder civilization was divided into compromise faction and resistance faction, but Their fate remains under investigation. \n\nNext we need to wait for a breakthrough from our researchers" #NT!

Although the clues in this ruins are not obvious, our researchers have still compiled some clues. The undersea base originated from the resistance faction of the ruins civilization. They are on the bottom of the sea. Weapons development and personnel training centers were established and attempted to use them to fight the enemy who destroyed them. \n\nBut strangely there are no obvious signs of battle. Our researchers speculate that it was abandoned, but the reason remains to be investigated. Next we need to conduct project research and investigation on crystals" #NT!

We can determine that the owner of this facility later issued an order requiring people to evacuate the shelter and move to A large number of data facilities are stored. Our researchers speculate that the site builders, after realizing that resistance was hopeless, attempted to preserve their history and data within the facility and leave the truth of history to the descendants of the race. \n\n§Y In any case, there are some clues left in the data facility. We should find and control the special stargate recorded in it. Our researchers think it should be the Kuat Stargate. §!" #NT!
