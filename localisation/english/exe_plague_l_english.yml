After preliminary deciphering, we found that this batch of information involves a wide range of academic research by descendants, including astrophysics, quantum mechanics, bioengineering, history, theology and other strange subjects. \n\nBut what shocks us even more is that this batch of information also contains descriptions of a certain "corruption epidemic." According to the documents, we will be exposed to these infectious diseases due to the taboo act of sacrificing our lives, but believe that we will overcome this. \n\nIn addition, this batch of materials also mentions a large number of forces that are still unknown to us. We only understand the history of the Endodian Empire and the $Name_kuat$ and the grievances between them, but other forces are still in the fog. , we don’t know the specific information yet. \n\nThe Endodia Empire has collapsed, and the shadow is still hanging over the sky. Maybe we should stop and re-examine our future. Maybe, the Endodia Empire is right. \n\nIn general, this discovery has opened the door to a broader level, but the way forward is still shrouded in mystery. We will remain vigilant and protect what we have worked so hard for at all costs. \n\nI sincerely hope that our civilization can embark on our great journey under your wise leadership."
