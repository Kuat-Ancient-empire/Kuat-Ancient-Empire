According to the documents, because we held the taboo of sacrificing life, we will be attacked by these infectious diseases, but we believe we will overcome it all. \n\nIn addition, this batch of information also mentioned a large number of forces that we still do not know. We only know the history of the Endodia Empire and $Name_kuat$ and the grievances between them, but other forces are still in the mist, and we do not know the specific information yet. \n\nThe Endodia Empire has collapsed, and the shadow still hangs over the sky.
