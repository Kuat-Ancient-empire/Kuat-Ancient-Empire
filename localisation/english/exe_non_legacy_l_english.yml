 Kuat_non_structure: "The monitoring department sent a message that a strange deep space tachyon signal with a special pattern was being transmitted to the entire universe, as if announcing the arrival of something. The scientific research team has preliminarily determined that the source of the signal came from an inconspicuous planet called Gaia, and successfully located the galaxy where the coordinates of the signal source planet are located." #NT!

 Kuat_non_structure_2: "After completing the preliminary investigation, our scientific research team successfully discovered a hidden and weak frequency band through long-term detection and monitoring of the signal frequency bands in the universe. Through the preliminary investigation of our scientific research team, it has been determined that it is located on a gas giant planet similar to the one discovered last time in our territory. The coordinates of this planet are coincidentally similar to the coordinates of the Zakuul galaxy, its capital, in the legendary documents of the Eternal Empire. This should mean a huge historical change, but the investigation of the scientific researchers in our team shows that the weak signal of this planet is more inclined to a certain degree of similarity with the introduction of the Force recorded in mythology. Perhaps we can take this opportunity to find something interesting." #NT!
 Kuat_non_legacy.1.name: "§ENear ground survey" #NT!
 Kuat_non_legacy.1.desc: "Our scientific research team successfully reached the planet's near-ground orbit, if the coordinates and signal frequency bands we detected earlier and inferred are almost exactly the same. As we got closer and closer to the planet's near-ground, the weak tachyon signal resonance became much stronger than what we detected from a distance, which is a good sign, indicating that we found the right place. \n\nAs our team arrived at the surface of the planet by landing ship, our scientific researchers found that the surface of the planet was covered by a certain form of matter that we had never seen before - the organization of these material energies was very similar to the Force recorded in our imperial documents. In the legendary records, this was neither the dark side of the Force nor the light side of the Force. As soon as we entered the atmosphere, our scientific research team sensed the ubiquitous and violent Force turbulence, and even natural Force lightning flashed under the clouds, which made the operation of entering the atmosphere for investigation increase sharply. In addition, the chaotic Force environment even affected the surrounding energy form and seriously interfered with the sensors on the scientific research ship. The crew on board is trying to increase the power of the sensors, which will take some time." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.2.desc: "Our researchers have gone through many difficulties and successfully overcome the adverse effects of the chaotic force environment in the planet's atmosphere on the investigation. After arriving on the surface of the planet, our researchers quickly used search equipment and reconnaissance drones to collect and search for geographical data in the area roughly within a radius of 500 kilometers from the landing point. \n\nHard work pays off. After analyzing the geographic data modeling, our researchers found that the continuous mountain ridges that should appear at the compression of normal continental plates have serious unnatural mountain fractures, as if they were cut off by some force. There we found that the tachyon signal resonance we had detected before was at the highest frequency, and we should spend some time going there to continue the investigation." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.3.desc: "When our researchers went to the fault point, they found that the natural environment here was affected by unknown force or artificial machines or forces, and there was a very big anomaly with the natural environment area around the planet. Some natural vegetation unique to the planet cannot grow on the ground here. The entire fault valley only has gray limestone-like ground rocks. Not only that, it also has a very strong energy radiation reaction. \n\nOur researchers did not search this place very smoothly based on the instruments, because this place cannot be explained by some natural conditions, and it is very close to the central reactor area of ​​Alderaan recorded in our imperial legend documents. Based on such speculation and guidance, our researchers successfully found an inconspicuous physical building in the hidden concave at the bottom of the valley. Our instruments completely lost their function due to the chaotic force environment. Our scientific research process will take some time." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.4.desc: "Our research team was unable to use instruments, so they had to venture into the building to investigate. During the investigation, our research team found that the internal facilities and equipment of the entire stone building were relatively well-preserved. Our observation and investigation of the equipment showed that these devices seemed to come from an alien civilization that was once at its peak. We couldn't even find out the technology it used through preliminary investigation of the equipment, but it should be similar to our technology. \n\nWhen our research team was at a loss, it seemed that a member activated a strange device. After a chaos, the equipment of the entire facility miraculously resumed operation. When our research team was thinking about retreating, a strange intelligent system applied for communication with our [leader.GetName]. These AIs actually have human sensibility, which is a miracle. Artificial intelligence issued its mechanized voice from all directions of the building. Our researchers found that the language spoken by the intelligent AI is very similar to ours. "Eternal Fleet...Empire...We are...free...The war...is over...Infinite Empire...Rakata...The Council...is destroyed..."\n\nBecause the entire ruins and the planet began to undergo drastic force changes, our research team did not have time to analyze what the AI ​​said after hearing the last message and had to leave the planet. But before leaving, [leader.GetName] brought back a natural product unique to the peculiar planet, a crystal with energy radiation." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.5.desc: "After successfully leaving the ancient facility, our researchers were shocked to find that the natural environment of the entire planet had undergone drastic changes. Their life support system could no longer support their continued activities. [leader.GetName] applied to leave the planet to ensure the safety of the researchers and to carry out specific analysis of the crystal samples on the planet." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.7.desc: "Hard work pays off. With the efforts of the elites in our scientific research department throughout the night, we successfully converted and compiled the resonant tachyon signal into the coordinate information we are familiar with, which will lead us to an ancient relic facility." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.8.name: "§E Gas planet orbit" #NT!
 Kuat_non_legacy.8.desc: "Our scientific research team, guided by the data of tachyon signal analysis, successfully found a seemingly ordinary gas giant planet. This planet is not much different from the general gas giant planets we have seen. It is just that the atmosphere of this planet is affected by the storm of the gas planet, which produces serious tachyon signal interference, which hinders our planetary scanning work. In desperation, our researchers can only try to find a normal area and venture into the surface of the gas planet to search for more valuable information. \n\nOur researchers found that the atmospheric storm of the gas giant planet presents a regular movement, which is different from the gas storms we have seen before. It seems to be affected by some strange force, but it will take some time for us to find the reason." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.9.desc: "Our researchers have made a great breakthrough in studying the state and laws of storms. Our research team found that although the storm in the planet's atmosphere seems to be chaotic and has some strange laws, we can control and use the state of this storm to find some valuable information. Our researchers found that there was a weak tachyon signal in the former eye of the storm behind the chaos of the planetary storm. Our researchers are determined to go there. Following the source of the signal, we came to the center of the storm. To our surprise, this floating inverted pyramid-shaped building spreads some kind of resonance form of the Force that seems to be recorded in our literature. The intensity of this turbulence reached its peak here, and the twisted and chaotic violent vortex met here. Even our battle-hardened elite members felt the terrifying scream that penetrated into their bones, as if the towering cold building in front of them was the gate of hell. The signal source is still working, continuing to send out the boring signal, attracting those who don't know the consequences." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.10.desc: "Our researchers decided to enter this strange inverted pyramid building. In our history, the inverted pyramid means weirdness and mystery, but we must investigate it clearly. Following the main passage of the building, the expedition team came to a circular hall with a diameter of about 20 meters. What is surprising is that the space in the entire inverted pyramid building is so small. A throne covered with a lot of dust and damp plants brought by history is located on the pedestal in the center of the hall. Our researchers did not stand there when they saw such a shocking scene. The research team found a strange square-shaped holographic device around the pedestal. \n\nOur researchers found that they could not simply activate the holographic device, but [leader.GetName] found that the turbulent force around the throne was used to flush the holographic device. After trying this, the holographic device seemed to be affected by a force from nowhere and floated from the hands of our researchers. The holographic device is about to be turned on!" #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.11.desc: "As the holocron slowly ascended, our researchers saw a vague human figure projected by the holocron. Perhaps because the holocron was too old, we could not recognize the human figure in the projection. He told a story. \n\nThis is a highly developed civilization. They are called Rakata. They established a powerful civilization across the entire galaxy, the Infinite Empire. They enslaved a large number of races and destroyed one civilization after another. \n\nBut their prosperity was short-lived. In the outbreak of a corrupt virus of unknown origin, this powerful empire quickly fell apart. The civilizations they enslaved also rose up and tried to deliver the final blow to this sinful empire. However, the Rakata people, unwilling to be destroyed, once again saved their empire. They used the technology obtained from $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ to develop a batch of intelligent combat weapons, among which the Aries and Gemini Eternal Fleets and Zildrog became their most powerful war machines. \n\nThe emperor of Rakata re-established the Infinite Empire, once again enslaved opponents, and caused one horrific galactic massacre after another. Such actions made the intelligent AI dissatisfied with the decision of the Infinite Empire. In the end, the Eternal Fleet of Aries and Gemini launched a devastating surprise attack. In this attack, the Infinite Empire went to extinction, many civilizations ushered in their freedom, and the Milky Way entered a new era. \n\nFrom then on, the Eternal Fleet was no longer stable, and they slaughtered one huge empire after another. We can't be sure whether this story is true or not, but we must be prepared for what may happen in the future. \n\n§RWarning: The threat of the Eternal Fleet may be rekindled." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.36.crisis.desc: "The Eternal Fleet that once ravaged the entire galaxy has now been completely defeated. We have not found any fish that have slipped through the net, and they will never be able to send reinforcements to our galaxy again. Our scientific research department has judged based on the Eternal Fleet's multiple attacks and the losses in this attack that the Eternal Fleet is already dead in name only, which means that the threat of the Eternal Fleet will never return to our star field. \nNow cheers and joy are full of the galaxy again. The end of the Eternal Fleet will forge a new era that belongs to us. Our research department has also analyzed new technology from the wreckage. \n\nIt is worth noting that the warning we once received in the ruins has come true. We should pay close attention to the changes in the galaxy next. Perhaps these stories are true." #NT!
