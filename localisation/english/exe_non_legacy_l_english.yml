 Kuat_non_structure: "The monitoring department sent news that a strange deep space tachyon signal showing a certain special pattern was being transmitted to the entire universe, as if announcing the arrival of something like this. The scientific research team has initially determined that the signal source comes from the inconspicuous planet Gaia, and has successfully located the galaxy where the coordinates of the signal source planet are located." #NT!

 Kuat_non_structure_2: "After completing the preliminary investigation, our scientific research team successfully discovered a hidden and weak frequency band through long-term detection and monitoring of the signal frequency band in the universe. Through the preliminary investigation of our scientific research team, it has been determined that it is the same as the last discovery. is located on a gas giant planet in our territory. The coordinates of this planet are very similar to the coordinates of its capital Zakuul system in the legendary documents of the Eternal Empire. This should mean a huge However, the investigation by the scientific researchers in our team shows that the weak signal of this planet is more similar to the introduction of the Force recorded in mythology to a certain extent. Perhaps we can take this opportunity to find something interesting." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.1.desc: "Our scientific research team successfully reached the planet's near-Earth orbit, if our early detection and inferred coordinates are almost exactly consistent with the signal frequency band. As we get closer and closer to the planet, the weak tachyon signal resonance becomes much stronger than what we detect from a distance. This is a good sign, and it indicates that we have found the right place. \n\nAs our team arrived on the planet's surface aboard a landing ship, our researchers discovered that the planet's surface was shrouded in a form of matter we had never seen before - these The organizational form of material energy is very similar to the Force recorded in our imperial literature. According to the legendary records, this is neither the Dark Side Force nor the Light Side Force. As soon as we entered the atmosphere, our scientific research team sensed the ubiquitous and violent Force turbulence, and even natural Force lightning flashed under the clouds. This made the risk factor of entering the atmosphere for investigation sharply increase. In addition, the chaotic Force environment has even affected the surrounding energy form and seriously interfered with the sensors on the scientific research ship. The personnel on the ship are trying to increase the power of the sensors as much as possible, which will take some time." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.2.desc: "Our scientific researchers have gone through many difficulties and successfully overcome the adverse effects on the investigation caused by the chaotic Force environment in the planet's atmosphere. After arriving on the surface of the planet, our scientific researchers quickly used search equipment and reconnaissance drones to collect and search geographical data in the area roughly within a radius of 500 kilometers from the landing point. \n\nThe hard work paid off. After analyzing the geographical data modeling, our researchers found that the continuous mountain ridges that should appear at the compression of normal continental plates had serious unnatural mountain fractures. It seems like it was cut off by some force, where we found that the previously detected tachyon signal resonance was at the highest frequency, and we should spend some time going there to continue the investigation." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.3.desc: "When our scientific researchers went to the fault point, they found that the natural environment here was affected by unknown forces or man-made machines or forces, resulting in very large abnormalities with the natural environment areas around the planet. Some of the planet's unique natural vegetation cannot grow on the ground here, and the entire fault valley has only gray limestone-like ground rocks. Not only that, but it also has a very strong energy radiation reaction. \n\nOur scientific researchers' search of this place based on instruments was not very smooth, because this place cannot be explained by some natural conditions, and it is very close to the Alderaan central reactor area recorded in our imperial legend documents. Based on such guesses and guidance, our scientific researchers successfully discovered an inconspicuous physical building in a hidden recess at the bottom of the valley. Our instruments completely lost their function due to the chaotic Force environment. Our scientific examination process will still take some time." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.4.desc: "Since our scientific research team was unable to use instruments, they had no choice but to venture into the building to conduct investigations. During the investigation process of our scientific research team, we found that the internal facilities and equipment of the entire stone building were relatively well maintained. Our observation and investigation of the equipment showed that these equipment seemed to come from an alien civilization that was once at its peak. We can't even tell from preliminary inspection of the device what technology it uses, but it should be similar to ours. \n\nWhen our scientific research team was at a loss, it seemed that a certain member activated a strange device. After a chaos, the entire facility's equipment miraculously started operating again. While our scientific research team was thinking of a way out, At that time, a strange intelligent system applied for communication with our [leader.GetName]. It was a miracle that these AIs actually had human sensibilities. The artificial intelligence made its mechanized voice from all directions of the building. Our scientific researchers have discovered that the language spoken by intelligent AI is very similar to ours. "The Eternal Fleet...the Empire...we are...free...the war...end...the Infinite Empire...Rakata...the Council...destruction... .."\n\nBecause the entire ruins and planet began to undergo drastic changes in the Force, our scientific research team had no time to analyze what the AI ​​said after listening to the final message, so they were not able to leave the planet, but they left. Previously, [leader.GetName] brought back a unique natural product on a strange planet, a crystal with energy radiation." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.8.desc: "Guided by the data analyzed from tachyon signals, our scientific research team successfully found a seemingly unremarkable gas giant planet. This planet is not very different from the ordinary gas giant planets we have seen. It is just that The atmosphere of the planet was affected by the storm of the gaseous planet, which produced severe tachyon signal interference, which hindered our planet scanning work. In desperation, our scientific researchers can only turn to trying to find a normal area and venture into the surface of the gaseous planet to search for more valuable information. \n\nOur scientific researchers have discovered that the atmospheric storms of gas giant planets exhibit a regular movement, which is different from the gas storms we have seen before. It seems to be affected by some strange force. But it will take some time before we find out why." #NT!

Our scientific research team has discovered that although the storms in the planet's atmosphere seem chaotic and have some strange patterns hidden in them, we can control and use this. Storm conditions to find some valuable information. Our scientific researchers discovered that there is a weak tachyon signal emitted from a former storm eye position behind the chaos of the planetary storm, and our scientific researchers are determined to go there. Following the source of the signal, we came to the center of the storm. To our scientific researchers' surprise, this floating inverted pyramid-shaped building spread some kind of resonance form that seemed to be the Force recorded in our literature. The intensity of this turbulence reached its peak here, and the twisted and chaotic violent whirlpools converged here. Even our battle-hardened elite members felt the terrifying scream that penetrated into the bone marrow, as if the towering cold building in front of them was The gates of hell. The signal source is still operating, continuing to send out boring signals, attracting those who do not know how to live or die." #NT!

 Kuat_non_legacy.10.desc: "Our scientific researchers decided to enter this weird inverted pyramid building. In our history, the inverted pyramid means weirdness and mystery, but we must investigate clearly. Following the main passage of the building, the scientific expedition team came to a rotunda with a diameter of about 20 meters. What is surprising is that the entire inverted pyramid building has such a small space. One surface has experienced a lot of dust and history. A humid plant-covered throne sits on a pedestal in the center of the hall. Our scientific researchers were not stunned when they saw such a shocking scene. The scientific research team found a strange square hologram device around the base as shown in the picture. \n\nOur scientific researchers found that it was not possible to simply activate the holograph, but [leader.GetName] found that the turbulence of the Force around the throne was used to wash away the holograph. After trying this, the holograph seemed to be affected by more than one force. The influence of the coming force is suspended from the hands of our scientific researchers, and the hologram is about to be turned on!" #NT!

They are called the Rakata people. They established a powerful civilization that spanned the entire galaxy--the Infinite Empire. They enslaved a large number of races and destroyed one after another. A civilization. \n\nBut their prosperity was short-lived. An outbreak of a corrupt and contagious virus from unknown sources caused this powerful empire to quickly fall apart. The civilizations they enslaved also rose up, trying to give this sinful empire the last straw. hit. However, the Rakata people who were unwilling to be destroyed once again saved their empire. They used the technology obtained from their descendants to develop a number of intelligent combat weapons. Among them, the Aries and Gemini Eternal Fleets, and Zildrog became their The most powerful war machine. \n\nThe Emperor of Rakata thought he was in control of everything and re-established the Infinite Empire, once again enslaving opponents and causing horrific galactic massacres one after another. Such behavior made the intelligent AI dissatisfied with the decision-making of the Infinite Empire. Until the ambitious emperor tried to abolish the Imperial Parliament in order to monopolize power and ordered the Eternal Fleet to launch an attack on the Imperial Parliament. As a result, fratricide caused the intelligent AI's expectations for the Rakata people to completely collapse. Among them, the eternal fleets of Aries and Gemini launched a devastating surprise attack. In this attack, the Infinite Empire withdrew from the stage of the galaxy and headed for destruction. Many civilizations ushered in their freedom, and the galaxy entered a new era. \n\nSince then, the Eternal Fleet has completely broken away from control and is moving forward in the pursuit of evolution and eternal freedom, but the Eternal Fleet still cannot escape their fate." #NT!
