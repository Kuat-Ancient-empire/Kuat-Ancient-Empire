Kuat_non_structure:0 "From the depths of the cosmos, a mysterious signal quietly arrives. It spreads through the vast universe with a unique rhythm, as if announcing the arrival of some unknown force to the endless stars. After precise detection and analysis, our scientific team has preliminarily identified the source of the signal—a seemingly insignificant Gaia world. Using advanced technology, they successfully pinpointed the star system coordinates of this planet, lifting a corner of the veil on this cosmic mystery."

Kuat_non_structure_2:0 "After completing the initial investigation, our scientific team spent many long years searching through the vast electromagnetic spectrum of the cosmos, seeking the faint light hidden in the darkness. Finally, a concealed and weak frequency band was captured—it was like a whisper from the depths of space, carrying a mysterious rhythm, silently transmitting across the stars.\n\nThrough tireless research and comparison, our team discovered that this frequency band bears an uncanny resemblance to a signal previously detected on a gas giant within our territory. That planet, long silent like a hermit of the cosmos, has now revealed an unknown side of itself through this exploration.\n\nEven more shocking is that the coordinates of this planet astonishingly match those of the capital system of the Eternal Empire, Zakul, as recorded in ancient imperial legends. This is no coincidence—it heralds the beginning of a great historical transformation. Perhaps the forgotten chapters of those ancient legends are waiting for us to rewrite them.\n\nHowever, further investigation by our researchers revealed that the faint signal from this planet bears an inexplicable resemblance to the Force described in myth—a primordial and powerful energy long sung of in countless legends, yet never truly proven. Now, it seems to beckon us forward, guiding us into an entirely new domain.\n\nPerhaps this is the opportunity fate has bestowed upon us. We shall seize it, delve deep into the mysteries of this enigmatic planet, uncover its hidden secrets, and seek the lost treasures and perhaps the powers that could reshape our future."
Kuat_non_legacy.1.name:0 "§ENear-Surface Survey"
Kuat_non_legacy.1.desc:0 "Our scientific team has successfully reached the near-surface orbit of this planet, and the coordinates and signal frequencies we initially detected and predicted align almost perfectly. As we descended closer to the planet's surface, the tachyon signal resonance, previously faint, has grown significantly stronger—a promising sign that we have indeed found the right location.\n\nAs our team descended to the planet's surface aboard landing craft, our researchers discovered that the surface is covered by a form of matter previously unseen to us. Its energetic structure bears a striking resemblance to the Force as recorded in our Imperial archives. According to ancient legends, this is neither the dark side nor the light side of the Force. Upon entering the atmosphere, our team immediately sensed the omnipresent, violent Force turbulence. Beneath the clouds, natural Force lightning crackled, greatly increasing the danger of atmospheric investigation. Furthermore, the chaotic Force environment severely disrupted the sensors aboard our research vessel. Our personnel are working to boost sensor output, which will take some time."

Kuat_non_legacy.2.desc:0 "Our researchers, having overcome the adverse effects of the chaotic Force environment in the planet's atmosphere, quickly began collecting geographical data within a 500-kilometer radius of the landing site using survey equipment and reconnaissance drones upon reaching the surface.\n\nTheir perseverance paid off. After analyzing the geographical data models, they discovered a severe, unnatural break in what should have been a continuous mountain range formed by the compression of continental plates—as if severed by some unknown force. At this location, the previously detected tachyon signal resonance reached its peak frequency. We should spend some time investigating this area further."

Kuat_non_legacy.3.desc:0 "As our researchers approached this fault point, they found that the natural environmental conditions here had been significantly altered by an unknown Force, artificial machinery, or some other power, creating a stark anomaly compared to the surrounding planetary environment. Vegetation unique to the planet cannot grow here, and the entire fault valley is composed only of grayish limestone-like rock. Moreover, there is a strong energy radiation reaction present.\n\nThe search conducted by our researchers using instruments here has not gone smoothly. Due to the inability to explain this location through natural phenomena, and its close resemblance to the area described in our Imperial legends as the Core Reactor Region of Alderaan, our researchers successfully discovered a seemingly insignificant physical structure hidden within a recess at the bottom of the valley. Our instruments have completely failed due to the chaotic Force environment. Our research efforts here will require additional time."

Kuat_non_legacy.4.desc:0 "Unable to use instruments, our research team was forced to take the risk of entering the structure for investigation. During their survey, they discovered that the interior facilities and equipment of this stone structure were relatively well-preserved. Observations and surveys of the equipment suggest that it belonged to an alien civilization that once stood at the peak of technological advancement. We cannot even determine the technology used in these devices through preliminary investigation, though it appears to be roughly comparable to our own.\n\nJust as our research team was at a loss, one of its members seemingly activated a strange device. After the ensuing chaos, the entire facility miraculously resumed operation. As our team was considering retreat, a peculiar artificial intelligence system requested communication with [leader.GetName]. These AIs possess human-like emotions—an astonishing miracle. Mechanical voices emanated from various directions within the structure. Our researchers found that the AI's language is extremely similar to our own: “Eternal Fleet... Empire... We... are free... War... over... Infinite Empire... Rakata... Council... Destruction...”\n\nAs the entire ruins and planet began to undergo violent Force fluctuations, our team was unable to analyze the AI's message before being forced to evacuate. However, before leaving, [leader.GetName] managed to retrieve a unique natural product from the planet—a crystal with energy radiation."

Kuat_non_legacy.8.desc:0 "Guided by the data obtained from the tachyon signal analysis, our research team successfully located what appears to be an ordinary gas giant. This planet does not differ significantly from other gas giants we have observed, except that its atmosphere is heavily disrupted by storms that generate intense tachyon signal interference, hindering our planetary scanning efforts. With no other options, our researchers have turned to searching for a normal area where they can risk descending into the upper layers of the gas giant to seek more valuable information.\n\nOur researchers have discovered that the atmospheric storms of this gas giant exhibit a rhythmic motion unlike any we have previously observed, seemingly influenced by some unusual force. However, determining its cause will take some time."

They discovered that although the planetary storms appear chaotic, they conceal a peculiar underlying pattern that we may be able to harness to uncover valuable information. Our researchers detected a faint tachyon signal emanating from a former storm eye within the chaos. Our team has decided to investigate this location.\n\nFollowing the signal source, we arrived at the storm's center. To our researchers' astonishment, a floating inverted pyramid-shaped structure was emitting a resonance form resembling the Force as described in our ancient records. The intensity of the turbulence here reaches its peak, with violent, chaotic whirlwinds converging in terrifying fashion. Even our battle-hardened elite members felt a bone-deep terror, as if the towering, cold edifice before them were the gates of hell itself. The signal source remains active, continuing to emit its monotonous signal, luring in the reckless and the curious alike."

Kuat_non_legacy.10.desc:0 "Our research team decided to enter this eerie inverted pyramid structure. In our history, an inverted pyramid symbolizes mystery and the uncanny, but we must investigate thoroughly. Proceeding down the main corridor, the expedition reached a circular chamber approximately twenty meters in diameter. Surprisingly, the interior of this inverted pyramid was remarkably small. At the center of a pedestal in the chamber sat a throne, covered in layers of dust and damp vegetation accumulated over centuries. Our researchers, though awestruck by this breathtaking sight, did not hesitate. Around the pedestal, they discovered a peculiar square-shaped device resembling a holographic projector.\n\nOur researchers were unable to activate the holographic projector easily, but [leader.GetName] discovered that channeling the Force turbulence around the throne through the device produced an effect. After attempting this, the holographic projector seemed to be affected by an unknown force, lifting from the researchers' hands and beginning to activate!"

Kuat_non_legacy.11.desc:0 "As the holographic projector slowly ascended, our researchers witnessed the projection of a faint humanoid figure. Due to the device's great age, the image was difficult to discern, but the story it told rang clearly in our ears.\n\nThis was a highly advanced civilization—the Rakata. They established a mighty empire spanning the entire galaxy: the Infinite Empire. They enslaved countless species and destroyed one civilization after another. Their prosperity, however, was fleeting. A mysterious corrupting plague erupted, rapidly causing the empire to collapse. The enslaved civilizations rose up, attempting to deliver the final blow to this wicked empire. Yet, unwilling to perish, the Rakata used technology obtained from $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ to develop a series of intelligent war machines, including the Aries and Gemini Eternal Fleets, with Childerog becoming their most powerful war machines.\n\nThe Rakatan Emperor reestablished the Infinite Empire, enslaving the rebels once more and orchestrating wave after wave of horrifying galactic massacres. But the sentient AI fleets grew discontent with the Infinite Empire's rule, and ultimately, the Aries and Gemini Eternal Fleets launched a devastating surprise attack. In this assault, the Infinite Empire fell, and many civilizations gained their freedom, ushering the galaxy into a new era.\n\nFrom then on, the Eternal Fleets became unstable, slaughtering one great empire after another. We cannot confirm the truth of this story, but we must prepare for any future events that may arise.\n\nWarning: The threat of the Eternal Fleets may reignite."

Kuat_non_legacy.36.crisis.desc:"Once ravaging the entire galaxy, the Eternal Fleets have now been utterly defeated, reduced to cosmic dust. We have scoured this region of space countless times, yet we have found no survivors. Their reinforcements will never again enter our star system. The once-feared threat has now become history.\n\nAfter countless analyses and simulations, our research department has reached an exhilarating conclusion based on the Eternal Fleets' repeated attacks and the losses from this final assault: the Eternal Fleets now exist in name only. That once-feared war machine has become a relic of the past. Once again, the skies of the galaxy are peaceful and serene.\n\nNow, joy and celebration fill the entire galaxy. The end of the Eternal Fleets marks not only the conclusion of an era but the dawn of a new one. Our research department has extracted new technologies from the wreckage of the Eternal Fleets, technologies that will bring unprecedented development opportunities to our civilization.\n\nYet, we have not allowed victory to cloud our judgment. The warning obtained from the ruins still echoes in our ears. We know the universe is full of unknowns and variables—perhaps these ancient stories are not entirely fictional. Therefore, we must closely monitor changes in the galaxy, remain vigilant, and be ready to face any new threats that may arise.\n\nOnce, we believed the Eternal Fleets were invincible, but now we have proven through action that as long as we stand united, nothing is impossible. This victory belongs to each and every one of us, to the entire galaxy. We will forever remember this moment and honor the heroes who gave everything for our triumph.\n\nLet us move forward together, embracing the brand-new era that awaits us."
