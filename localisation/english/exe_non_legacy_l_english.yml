 Kuat_non_structure:0 "Deep in the cosmos, a mysterious signal quietly arrives, spreading through the vast universe with a unique rhythm, as if announcing the arrival of some unknown force to the endless stars. After precise detection and analysis, the scientific team has preliminarily identified the source of the signal—a seemingly insignificant Gaia world. Using advanced technology, they successfully pinpointed the star system coordinates of this world, lifting a corner of the veil on this cosmic mystery."

 Kuat_non_structure_2:0 "After completing the initial investigation, our scientific team, after many long years of searching through the vast cosmic signal spectrum, has finally captured a hidden and faint frequency. It is like a whisper from the depths of the universe, carrying a mysterious rhythm, silently transmitting across the stars.\n\nThrough tireless research and comparison by the team, we discovered that this frequency is extremely similar to a signal previously detected on a gas giant within our territory. That planet, like a hermit in the cosmos, has long remained unknown, yet in this exploration, it has revealed an aspect of itself previously unseen.\n\nEven more astonishing is that the coordinates of this planet astonishingly match those of the capital system of Zakul, recorded in the ancient literature of the Eternal Empire. This is no coincidence—it heralds the beginning of a great historical transformation. Perhaps the forgotten chapters of those ancient legends are waiting for us to rewrite them.\n\nHowever, the researchers further discovered that this faint signal bears an uncanny resemblance to the mythical Force described in ancient texts. It is an ancient and powerful energy, long sung of in countless legends, yet never truly proven to exist. Now, it seems to beckon us forward, guiding us into an entirely new domain.\n\nPerhaps this is the opportunity fate has bestowed upon us. We shall seize it to deeply explore this mysterious planet, uncover its hidden secrets, seek the lost treasures of ancient legends, and discover the powers that may reshape our future."

 Kuat_non_legacy.1.desc:0 "Our scientific team has successfully reached near-surface orbit of this world, and the coordinates and signal frequencies we initially detected and predicted align almost perfectly. As we descended closer to the planet's surface, the faint tachyon signal resonance has grown significantly stronger compared to our earlier long-range scans—a promising sign, indicating we have indeed found the right location.\n\nAs our team descended to the planet's surface aboard landing craft, the researchers discovered that the surface of the world is covered in a form of matter previously unseen by our Empire. The energetic structure of these materials bears a striking resemblance to the Force described in Imperial records. According to ancient legends, this was neither the dark side nor the light side of the Force. Upon entering the atmosphere, our scientific team immediately sensed the omnipresent, violent Force turbulence, and beneath the clouds, natural Force lightning crackled, greatly increasing the danger level of the atmospheric survey. Furthermore, the chaotic Force environment has severely disrupted the sensors aboard the science ship. The crew is working to boost sensor output, which will take some time."

 Kuat_non_legacy.2.desc:0 "Our scientists, having overcome the adverse effects caused by the chaotic Force environment in the planet's atmosphere, quickly began collecting geographical data within a 500-kilometer radius of the landing site using survey equipment and reconnaissance drones upon reaching the surface.\n\nTheir perseverance paid off. After analyzing the geographical data models, the researchers discovered a severe, unnatural break in what should have been a continuous mountain ridge formed by normal tectonic compression. It was as if some force had severed it. At this location, we detected the highest frequency of tachyon signal resonance yet. We should spend some time investigating this area further."

 Kuat_non_legacy.3.desc:0 "As our researchers approached this fault point, they found that the natural environmental conditions here had been significantly altered by an unknown Force, artificial machinery, or other power, creating a major anomaly compared to the surrounding natural environment of the planet. Vegetation native to the planet cannot grow here. The entire fault valley is composed only of grayish limestone-like rock, and it exhibits a notably intense energy radiation reaction.\n\nOur researchers' attempts to scan the area with instruments have not gone smoothly. Since this location cannot be explained by natural phenomena and closely matches descriptions of the Core Reactor Zone of Alderaan found in our Imperial legends, following this clue, the team successfully discovered a seemingly insignificant physical structure hidden within a concealed depression at the bottom of the valley. Our instruments have completely failed due to the chaotic Force environment. Our research efforts here will require additional time."

 Kuat_non_legacy.4.desc:0 "Unable to use their instruments, our scientific team had no choice but to risk entering the structure for direct investigation. During their survey, they found that the internal facilities and equipment of this stone structure were relatively well-preserved. Upon examining the devices, the team determined that they appeared to belong to an alien civilization that once stood at the peak of technological advancement. Even preliminary analysis failed to reveal the technology behind these devices, though it appeared to be roughly comparable to our own.\n\nJust as the team was at a loss, one of its members seemingly activated a strange device. In the chaos that followed, the entire facility miraculously came back to life. As the team considered their escape route, a peculiar artificial intelligence system requested communication with [leader.GetName]. These AIs exhibited human-like emotions—an astonishing miracle. Mechanical voices emanated from various parts of the structure. Our researchers found that the AI's language was surprisingly similar to our own: 'Eternal Fleet... Empire... We... are free... War... over... Infinite Empire... Rakata... Council... Destruction...'\n\nAs the entire ruins and planet began to experience violent Force fluctuations, the research team had no time to analyze the AI's message before being forced to evacuate. However, before leaving, [leader.GetName] managed to retrieve a unique natural product native to this world—a crystal emitting energy radiation."

 Kuat_non_legacy.8.desc:0 "Guided by the data obtained from the tachyon signal analysis, our scientific team has successfully located what appears to be an ordinary gas giant. This world shows little difference from typical gas giants we have encountered before, except that its atmosphere is heavily disrupted by storms, generating intense tachyon signal interference that hinders our planetary scanning operations. With no other options, our researchers are now attempting to locate a stable region and risk descending into the upper layers of the gas giant in search of more valuable information.\n\nOur researchers have discovered that the atmospheric storms of this gas giant exhibit a rhythmic motion unlike any previously observed gas giant storms. It appears to be influenced by some unusual force, but determining the cause will take time."

The team discovered that although the planetary storms appear chaotic, they contain a strange underlying order that we may be able to harness to uncover valuable information. Our researchers detected a faint tachyon signal emanating from a former storm eye deep within the chaos. The team has decided to follow the signal source to this location.\n\nUpon reaching the storm's center, the researchers were astonished to find a floating inverted pyramid-shaped structure emitting a resonance pattern resembling the Force described in our ancient texts. The intensity of the turbulence here reaches its peak, with violent, chaotic whirlwinds converging in terrifying shrieks. Even our most seasoned elite members felt bone-deep fear, as if the towering, cold structure before them was the very gates of hell. The signal source continues to operate, sending out its monotonous transmission, luring the reckless and the curious alike."

 Kuat_non_legacy.10.desc:0 "Our researchers decided to enter this eerie inverted pyramid structure. In our history, inverted pyramids symbolize the strange and the mysterious, but we must investigate. Following the main corridor, the expedition reached a circular chamber approximately twenty meters in diameter. Surprisingly, the interior of the inverted pyramid was far smaller than expected. At the center of the chamber stood a throne, covered in dust and damp vegetation from centuries of neglect. Our researchers did not hesitate at the sight, and near the throne's pedestal, they discovered a strange, square-shaped device resembling a holoprojector.\n\nThe researchers were unable to activate the holoprojector directly, but [leader.GetName] discovered that channeling the Force turbulence around the throne through the device produced an effect. When this was attempted, the holoprojector seemed to respond to an unseen force, levitating from the researcher's hands—it was about to activate!"

 Kuat_non_legacy.11.desc:0 "As the holoprojector slowly rose into the air, our researchers witnessed the projection of a faint humanoid figure. Due to the device's great age, the image was difficult to discern, but the story it told rang clearly in our ears.\n\nThis was a highly advanced civilization—the Rakata. They built a vast empire spanning the entire galaxy: the Infinite Empire. They enslaved countless species and destroyed one civilization after another, yet their prosperity was fleeting. A mysterious, corrupting plague erupted, rapidly tearing the mighty empire apart. The enslaved civilizations rose up, attempting to deliver the final blow to this wicked empire. Yet, unwilling to perish, the Rakata used technology obtained from $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ to develop a series of intelligent war machines, including the Aries and Gemini Eternal Fleets, with Childe Ro'gra as their most powerful war machine.\n\nThe Rakatan Emperor reestablished the Infinite Empire, enslaving the rebels once more and orchestrating wave after wave of horrifying galactic massacres. But the sentient AI of the Eternal Fleets grew discontent with the Empire's decisions, and eventually, the Aries and Gemini fleets launched a devastating surprise attack. In this assault, the Infinite Empire fell, and many civilizations gained their freedom, ushering the galaxy into a brand new era.\n\nFrom that point on, the Eternal Fleets became unstable, slaughtering one great empire after another. We cannot confirm the truth of this story, but we must prepare for the possibility of such events recurring in the future.\n\nWarning: The threat of the Eternal Fleets may rise again."

 Kuat_non_legacy.36.crisis.desc: "Once ravaging the entire galaxy, the Eternal Fleets have now been utterly defeated, reduced to cosmic dust. We have scoured this star region countless times, finding no survivors. Their reinforcements will never again enter our star system. The once-feared threat has now become a thing of the past.\n\nAfter countless analyses and simulations, our research department has reached a thrilling conclusion based on the repeated attacks of the Eternal Fleets and the losses sustained in this final assault: the Eternal Fleets now exist in name only. That once-feared war machine has now become history. The skies of the Milky Way are once again peaceful and serene.\n\nNow, joy and celebration fill the galaxy once more. The end of the Eternal Fleets marks not only the conclusion of an era, but the dawn of a new one. Our research teams have extracted entirely new technologies from the wreckage of the Eternal Fleets—technologies that will bring unprecedented development opportunities to our civilization.\n\nHowever, we have not allowed victory to cloud our judgment. The warning obtained from the ancient ruins still echoes in our ears. We understand that the universe is filled with the unknown and the unpredictable, and perhaps these ancient stories are not entirely fiction. Therefore, we must closely monitor changes within our star systems, remain vigilant, and always be prepared to face any new threats that may arise.\n\nOnce, we believed the Eternal Fleets were unbeatable, but now we have proven through action that nothing is impossible as long as we stand united. This victory belongs to each and every one of us, to the entire galaxy. We will always remember this moment, and the heroes who gave everything for our triumph.\n\nLet us move forward together, embracing the brand new era that is now ours."
