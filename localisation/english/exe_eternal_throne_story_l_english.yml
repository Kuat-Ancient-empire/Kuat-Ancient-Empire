Because the light emitted by its star is very weak, the Endodia Empire uses its characteristics to use it as a hidden military fortress. All military power, economic and technical talents are concentrated in this galaxy. In the final years of their war with Kuat, it became the last area of control of the Endodian Empire. \n\nThe scanning results of our researchers in this galaxy show that compared to the previous facility area, there are larger shipwrecks in the galaxy. It seems that in $misc_system_desc_5$, the Endodian Empire and Quan A larger-scale battle broke out in the Te Empire. By estimation, the ships damaged here have exceeded the upper limit of military power as we know it. However, after experiencing the tragic battle, only shipwrecks and damaged giant structures are left everywhere. \n\nIn addition, according to our investigation report in this system, it is here that the last emperor of the empire, Endodia I, made a deal with the Oversight Council. They conspired to reach some kind of agreement, because this According to the agreement, the Oversight Council prevented Kuat from annihilating the Endodia Empire. As a price, the emperor was escorted to the control area of ​​the Oversight Council, and all the research materials on Isotope 5 secretly conducted by his empire were also supervised. Obtained by the Oversight Council, the Oversight Council has always guarded this fortress. It is unknown how this situation will affect the Eternal Fleet, but we cannot take it lightly. \n\nFortunately, under the wise leadership of our imperial leader, we destroyed the Overseer Council's guard fleet, restarted the star gate and obtained Isotope 5, and our eternal fleet was repaired. However, with the coordinated operations of our fleet and the Eternal Fleet, the returning Kuat Empire was completely destroyed by us, and now they should no longer be arrogant. \n\nIn short, we can currently confirm the following points:\n1.$misc_system_desc_5$ is the real last capital of the Endodian Empire, and it is also the location where they have been conducting secret research on the Eternal Fleet. \n2. The war between the Kuat Empire and the Endodia Empire broke out completely with the destruction of the Oversight Council, and the Endodia Empire ended with its destruction. \n3. The Oversight Council obtained research information on Isotope 5 by ensuring the racial survival of the Endodian Empire. It is currently uncertain what impact it will have on the Eternal Fleet. \n4. We can now be sure that we have completely defeated the Kuat Empire. \n\nBut the current situation is still confusing and we still need to continue investigating."

After investigating its energy signature, we discovered that all previously discovered signals originated from it. \n\nDue to the special geographical features of the planet itself and the interference from the camouflaged position, the signal from the central star pile cannot be transmitted directly.

Researchers speculate that due to the damage to the control system, the material transportation system of the entire ship may have been completely paralyzed, and the isotope-5 structure will be in a dilemma because there is no injection of external material, and there will be no more material to continue the energy release reaction. and will eventually self-destruct due to lack of fuel. \n\nSince the disintegration of the isotope-5 structure will change the gravitational structure of the ship and eventually lead to the collapse of the main structure, our scientific researchers have to step up their investigation of some of the secured cabins. \n\nIn our further investigation, we found some surviving paper documents, which also greatly assisted the progress of our language deciphering team's project. \n\nAfter deciphering the basic nature and elements of the other party's language, our language translation team discovered that the voice and intonation used in this unknown star warship are similar to the language used in the era of our ancestors.

In addition, by retrieving data from some of the remaining data terminals, our scientific research team successfully mastered the basic structural characteristics of this ship driven by the isotope-5 structure, and obtained some properties related to the isotope-5 structure.
