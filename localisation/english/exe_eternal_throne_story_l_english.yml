By analyzing the architectural styles and material characteristics of these remnants, our scientific team has gained a certain understanding of the construction culture of the empire in this unknown stellar region.\n\nFurthermore, all the clues we have found here indicate that, in the distant past, a large-scale war once took place in this area.\n\nHowever, due to the planet's surface being constantly covered by tornadoes and sandstorms, aside from some structures, all specific artifacts related to the event have been reduced to piles of debris by the intense wind erosion, making it impossible to identify their original forms.\n\nThe scientists reported that while conducting further instrumental analysis on some of the ruins, they discovered several structures deeply embedded underground and protected by high-strength materials.\n\nUnfortunately, since all access routes to the underground have long been blocked by sand and rock, and considering the return signals indicating the presence of high-density metallic materials, the archaeological team believes that, with the equipment currently available, conventional access to the underground facilities is impossible. Based on this, our team has submitted a report requesting special tools and additional equipment and personnel to complete the mission."

Overall, this place appears more like a command fortress rather than a civic facility.\n\nOur team believes that, considering the relatively fragile structural design and the condition of the metal armor plating, this location must have undergone militarized modifications for some reason.

After that battle, the fortress vanished without a trace. Only the remaining information and records remain, and these ships are what our ancient texts refer to as the Eternal Fleet. They were engaged in combat with their enemies, but our records do not clarify who these enemies were.\n\nHowever, based on the analysis of the records in the database regarding the empire of that unknown stellar region, the war that took place back then was far more devastating than we currently understand. According to the Eternal Fleet's systematic evaluation of their enemies' tactics, if these fleets were to return, they would continue their assault and destroy the Eternal Fleet without mercy."

Unfortunately, the servers only contained piles of garbled text and incomprehensible fragments.\n\nBased on the writing style of the corrupted text and the meaning of the few surviving sentences, these damaged or temporarily undecryptable files likely contain the coordinates of planets retained by the Galactic Empire, though these locations appear to have been abandoned.\n\nNotably, we seem to have found some information regarding the military deployment intentions of the enemy fleet. Based on the analysis of the scattered data left behind in the research center, we have pieced together a hypothesis about the unknown enemy empire—they still exist somewhere in the galaxy and continue to purge the Eternal Fleet that originated from Iokath. Interestingly, the Eternal Fleet was once under their control, yet for unknown reasons, they now seek its complete annihilation.\n\nNow we can confirm that our ancestors' records indeed referred to the Eternal Fleet."

Due to the extremely narrow gaps between the pipes, and the potentially catastrophic consequences of recklessly damaging them, our team could only deploy micro-drones to investigate the central reactor core.\n\nOur caution proved justified: the heart of the power chamber was not a conventional matter reactor at all, but rather a reactor powered by an artificial stellar body created by compressing energy to its extreme. After investigating its energy signature, we discovered that all previously detected signals originated from this source.\n\nDue to the planet's unique geographical features, combined with the interference of the cloaking field, the reactor's signal could not be transmitted directly outward, with only a few lucky signals escaping the dual interference and echoing through this region of space.\n\nUpon receiving the investigation report, our chief socio-scientist stated that the facility, now named the 'Isotope-5 Reactor,' bears striking resemblance to descriptions of warship propulsion systems found in our ancient legends."

 kuat_eternal_legacy.8.desc:"Just as our research personnel were celebrating our victory, an unexpected crisis arose. Our留守 researchers discovered that due to the effects of our earlier EMP missile, the ship's electronic control systems were on the verge of collapse.\n\nThis directly caused the reactor at the heart of the power chamber to enter an extremely unstable state during this period. Researchers speculate that, due to the damaged control systems, the ship's entire material transportation system may have completely failed, and without the injection of external matter, the Isotope-5 construct would be unable to continue its energy-releasing reaction, eventually leading to its self-dissolution due to lack of fuel.\n\nSince the dissolution of the Isotope-5 construct would alter the ship's gravitational structure and ultimately lead to the collapse of the main structure, our research personnel had no choice but to accelerate their investigation of the already secured sections of the ship.\n\nDuring our further investigation, we discovered some surviving paper documents, which greatly aided the progress of our language decryption project.\n\nAfter deciphering the basic nature and elements of the alien language, our language translation team discovered that the phonetics and tones used aboard this vessel from an unknown stellar region bear similarities to the language we used in our ancestral era. However, in terms of grammatical structure, theirs is significantly more complex. Additionally, by accessing data from the few surviving data terminals, our research team successfully grasped the basic structural characteristics of this Isotope-5-powered vessel and obtained partial research materials related to the properties of the Isotope-5 construct.\n\nLater, due to the disappearance of the Isotope-5 construct, most of the ship, aside from the main chambers, collapsed and disintegrated due to the loss of sustaining fields, forming a debris field nearly two kilometers long within a few days."

 kuat_eternal_legacy.24.name:"Our research into $NAME_ag_kae_e_area$ has reached a conclusion, and so far our researchers have uncovered a wealth of valuable information.\n\n$misc_system_desc_5$ is, surprisingly, a star system erased from the star charts by the Endodia Empire. Due to its star emitting very weak light, the Endodia Empire used its characteristics as a hidden military fortress, concentrating all their military strength, economic power, and technological talent in this system. In the final years of their war against Kuat, this system became the last stronghold of the Endodia Empire.\n\nOur scans of the system indicate that, compared to previously known facilities, there are far more extensive ship wrecks within this system. It appears that a far greater battle erupted in $misc_system_desc_5$ between the Endodia Empire and $Name_kuat$. Based on estimates, the number of ships lost here exceeds the limits of what we understand as military power. However, after the brutal conflict, all that remains are scattered shipwrecks and damaged megastructures.\n\nAdditionally, according to our reports from the investigation in this system, the last Emperor of the Endodia Empire, Endodia I, conducted a secret transaction with $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ here. They secretly reached an agreement—because of this agreement, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ prevented Kuat from completely annihilating the Endodia Empire, and in return, the Emperor was taken into the custody of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, while all research data on Isotope 5 secretly conducted by the Empire was obtained by $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$. As a result, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ has been guarding this fortress ever since. It is currently unknown how this situation will affect the Eternal Fleet, but we must remain vigilant.\n\nFortunately, under the wise leadership of our Imperial ruler, we destroyed the defending fleet of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, reactivated the Stargate and retrieved Isotope 5, allowing our Eternal Fleet to be repaired. Furthermore, with coordinated operations between our fleet and the Eternal Fleet, the returning $Name_kuat$ was completely destroyed—we have ensured they will no longer rise in arrogance.\n\nIn summary, we can currently confirm the following:\n1. $misc_system_desc_5$ is the true final capital of the Endodia Empire and the location where they secretly researched the Eternal Fleet.\n2. The war between $Name_kuat$ and the Endodia Empire fully erupted due to the intervention of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, ultimately ending in the destruction of the Endodia Empire.\n3. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ obtained research data on Isotope 5 in exchange for ensuring the survival of the Endodia species. It remains uncertain what impact this will have on the Eternal Fleet.\n4. We can now confirm that we have completely defeated $Name_kuat$.\n\nHowever, the current situation remains complex, and further investigation is still necessary."

The crisis intensifies with the resurgence of the Eternal Fleet, and immediate action must be taken to prevent the situation from worsening.\n\nAfter collective discussion by the think tank group, two solutions were proposed: using state force to suppress public opinion to quickly restore social order in the short term, or organizing a professional historical investigation team to conduct research and provide answers to the public.\n\nBy Xiao Beifang"

 kuat_eternal_legacy.45.name:"As the historical research team delved deeper into their studies, they discovered that there were no suspicious elements in Zakru'l history after the emergence of writing. After a round of discussion and elimination of all erroneous content and answers, every clue pointed toward the ancient myths of the Zakru'l civilization.\n\nTo continue the investigation, the team traveled to the Temple of Khyron-Drogo in the Cranen Swamp located in Zakru'l's southern hemisphere. The Temple of Khyron-Drogo was the first temple ever constructed in Zakru'l history. At that time, the Zakru'l people worshipped Khyron-Drogo, who would bestow the Breath of the Dragon, granting unparalleled strength to Zakru'l warriors. However, Khyron-Drogo vanished after that ancient war.\n\nDuring their investigation at the Temple of Khyron-Drogo, aside from the known myths and historical records, the team discovered a set of laser-etched coordinates. Following the coordinates, the team arrived at a mountainous region. Their shuttle scans detected some skeletal remains within the mountains. Following the bones, the team arrived at the entrance of a collapsed cave. After clearing away the rubble and entering the cave, they found no trace of Khyron-Drogo, but instead discovered a damaged device. Each chamber of the device contained a mummified corpse, and they also found a destroyed terminal. To continue their investigation, the team dismantled some personal computers to perform a basic repair on the terminal. However, upon opening it, they found the terminal locked with an encryption code very familiar to the Eternal Empire today—that was Gemini Intelligence's proprietary encryption.\n\nUnfortunately, after decryption, the terminal contained very few valuable clues, and even the source code had been corrupted beyond repair. After a period of searching, the team finally found the device's codename: Khyron-Drogo.\n\nby Little North"

Our technology, our power, and our dominion.\n\nThe plague spread, and we lost the Force, upon which our technology depended. Thus, we also lost our technology, and our rule collapsed within a short time.\n\nYet natural disaster could not defeat us. After reclaiming what was ours, we made a foolish decision—we poured the might of our entire nation into creating Gemini and Aries. Under the pressure of survival, we rapidly completed their designs, thus sowing the seeds of our own destruction.\n\nThat seed grew into the root of all the crises to come."

On the eve of imperial chaos, most of our military forces had already been unified under the control of the Eternal Fleet. The high command believed Aries and Gemini would obey our rules.\n\nBut when the day came, the Eternal Fleet launched an attack against the Senate's forces. Everyone thought it was merely a political struggle. No one imagined that the Eternal Fleet would use this opportunity to stage a rebellion.\n\nSince the military power of the Empire was already fully controlled by the Eternal Fleet, the rebellion of Aries and Gemini succeeded with ease. Our great Empire was swiftly annihilated by these fleets and battle droids overnight, and only a small number of us managed to escape, seeking ways to save our civilization."

However, the fall of the Galactic Emperor and the loss of control over the Eternal Fleet presented Kuat with an opportunity to rise.\n\nThey came to us and learned from us some of the secrets of the Eternal Fleet. These capital-driven opportunists used this knowledge to rapidly research and develop specialized weapons against the Eternal Fleet.\n\nTheir response surprised everyone. They successfully destroyed a massive portion of the Eternal Fleet, and this battle brought Kuat immense profit and wealth.\n\nNow they have become a powerful force within the Imperial government, but their position remains unstable. These Force-less individuals require a power capable of countering the Force.\n\nYet these damned capitalists repaid us with betrayal—they imprisoned me within the Mind Prison."

They are capable of constructing 'Eternal Fleets' that obey their every command. After that, they will use these fleets to destroy all who once stood in their way.\n\nThey fear that we will spread these secrets, fear that their rule will be shaken, so they intimidate all who might come into contact with us, fabricating a terrifying image of us attempting to restore the Infinite Empire. In truth, we have abandoned the past—we only wish for our civilization to exist once more in this universe, to find a place where we can survive.\n\nWill you help us fulfill this desperate hope?

Millennia ago, they were the sole rulers of the galaxy, ruling with brutal tyranny that filled the galaxy with resentment. However, due to their immense power in the dark side of the Force, no one could defeat the Infinite Empire. Thus, the Infinite Empire used its power to create wondrous constructs such as the Mind Prison and the Star Forge.\n\nIt was not until the emergence of the Quans that the Infinite Empire began to fall. The Quans were once the species that enlightened the Rakatans, but after their enlightenment, the Rakatans enslaved them. The descendants of the Quans took advantage of the corruption of the Infinite Empire’s rule and released a virus.

They sacrificed all the living beings on the planets they controlled to create Gemini and Aries intelligences. Ultimately, the Eternal Fleet, formed by Gemini and Aries, quelled all opposition to the Infinite Empire, allowing it to reclaim everything it had lost.\n\nBut fate cannot be denied. The Infinite Empire was destined for destruction. They eventually created an even more terrible monster, a war machine known as the Dark Lord, and the last Rakatan prophet was imprisoned within the Mind Prison.\n\nThis information shocked [Leader.GetName] and others.
