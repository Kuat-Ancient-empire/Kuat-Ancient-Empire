 misc_system_desc_5_desc_finished:"Our research into $NAME_ag_kae_e_area$ has reached a conclusion, and so far our researchers have uncovered a wealth of valuable information.\n\n$misc_system_desc_5$ turns out to be a system erased from the star map by the Endordia Empire. Due to the extremely weak light emitted by its star, the Endordia Empire used its characteristics as a hidden military fortress, concentrating all of their military forces and economic and technological talents there. In the final years of their war with Kuat, this system became the last controlled territory of the Endordia Empire.\n\nScans of the system by our researchers show that compared to previous facility zones, there are far more extensive ship wrecks within the system. It seems that in $misc_system_desc_5$, the Endordia Empire and $Name_kuat$ engaged in an even larger scale battle. Based on estimates, the number of ships lost here has exceeded the limits of military power we understand, but after the brutal battle, only scattered ship wrecks and damaged megastructures remain.\n\nAdditionally, according to our investigation report on this system, the last Emperor of the Empire, Endordia I, conducted a secret transaction with $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ here. They secretly reached some kind of agreement. Because of this agreement, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ prevented Kuat from completely annihilating the Endordia Empire, while in return, the Emperor was sent to the control zone of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, and all of the Empire's secret research data regarding Isotope 5 was obtained by $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$. As a result, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ has been guarding this fortress ever since. It is currently unknown how this situation will affect the Eternal Fleet, but we must not let our guard down.\n\nFortunately, under the wise leadership of our Imperial leader, we destroyed the defending fleet of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, reactivated the Gateway, and obtained Isotope 5, allowing our Eternal Fleet to be repaired. However, with coordinated operations between our fleet and the Eternal Fleet, the returning $Name_kuat$ was completely destroyed, and now they should no longer be able to act arrogantly.\n\nIn summary, we can currently confirm the following:\n1. $misc_system_desc_5$ is the true final capital of the Endordia Empire, and also the location where they secretly conducted research on the Eternal Fleet.\n2. The war between $Name_kuat$ and the Endordia Empire fully erupted due to the intervention of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, ultimately ending with the destruction of the Endordia Empire.\n3. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ obtained the research data on Isotope 5 in exchange for guaranteeing the survival of the Endordia species, and it remains uncertain what impact this will have on the Eternal Fleet.\n4. We can now confirm that we have completely defeated $Name_kuat$.\n\nHowever, the current situation remains complex and unclear, and further investigation is still required."

Witnessing this, our scientific team immediately realized that there must be some kind of device in this area capable of confusing both our vision and electronic signals, and promptly launched an EMP missile in an attempt to overload all electronic devices in the area.\n\nIt turned out they were right: a strange and enormous alien warship was docked right before their eyes."

Driven by such curiosity, our team quickly boarded the bridge and began inspecting the interior of the vessel.\n\nAfter some unexplained forceful entry, we finally managed to enter the ship's interior. The main structure of this warship has sustained a certain degree of damage, and the interior of the entire vessel has already become somewhat dilapidated. After some searching, we focused our attention on several compartments whose functions remain unknown."

With this in mind, we launched an investigation into the compartment suspected to be the power core chamber located at the ship's rear."

Since the gaps between the pipes are too narrow and recklessly damaging them could lead to catastrophic consequences, our team was forced to deploy micro-drones to investigate the central reactor core.\n\nOur caution proved justified: the heart of the power chamber was not a conventional matter reactor at all, but rather a reactor powered by an artificial stellar body—compressed energy refined to its utmost extreme. After analyzing its energy signature, we discovered that all previously detected signals originated from this very source.\n\nDue to the planet's unique geographical features, combined with interference from a camouflage field, the signal from the central stellar reactor could not be directly transmitted outward—only a few lucky signals managed to escape this dual interference, echoing through this region of space.\n\nUpon receiving the investigation report, our chief socio-scientist stated that the structural features of this facility, now named the 'Isotope-5 Reactor,' bear an almost identical resemblance to the descriptions of warship propulsion systems found in our ancient legends."

 kuat_eternal_legacy.8.desc:"Just as our research personnel were celebrating our victory, an unexpected crisis arose. Our留守 researchers discovered that due to the EMP missile we launched earlier, the ship's electronic control systems are now on the verge of collapse.\n\nThis has directly caused the reactor at the heart of the power chamber to enter an extremely unstable state. Researchers speculate that, due to the damaged control systems, the ship's entire material transport system may have completely failed, and without external material injection, the Isotope-5 construct will be unable to continue its energy-releasing reaction, eventually leading to its self-destruction due to fuel starvation.\n\nSince the collapse of the Isotope-5 construct will alter the ship's gravitational structure and ultimately lead to the disintegration of the main structure, our research personnel had no choice but to accelerate their investigation of the already secured sections of the vessel.\n\nDuring our further investigation, we discovered some surviving paper documents, which greatly assisted our linguistic decryption project.\n\nAfter deciphering the basic nature and elements of their language, our translation team discovered that the speech patterns used aboard this vessel from an unknown sector bear some resemblance to the language used in our ancestral era. However, grammatically, their language is significantly more complex. Additionally, by retrieving data from the few surviving data terminals, our research team successfully gained an understanding of the basic structural characteristics of these Isotope-5-powered vessels and obtained partial research data related to the properties of the Isotope-5 construct.\n\nLater, due to the disappearance of the Isotope-5 construct, most of the ship, aside from the main chamber, collapsed due to the loss of sustaining fields, disintegrating within a few days into a debris field nearly two kilometers long."

Perhaps this report will help us uncover the hidden secrets:\n\nThe Galactic Empire was once the controller and master of the Eternal Fleet. At one point, they were drawn into a war. Initially, the conflict revolved around a few resource-rich worlds, but as time passed, more and more worlds joined the war.\n\nThey formed alliances, and the flames of war spread across the galaxy. Although the Imperial Fleet was unmatched in the stars, and the Eternal Fleet under their control terrified their enemies, the prolonged war of attrition gradually became more and more intense. The Imperial Fleet became overwhelmed and stretched too thin.\n\nAs the war escalated, the Imperial government gradually lost its ability to resist enemy raids.\n\nIn a decisive battle, the Imperial Fleet fought against all the rebels, ultimately ending with the destruction of the Imperial Fleet and the Emperor himself.\n\nThe Emperor’s death caused the Eternal Fleet to lose its commander, transforming them into mindless killing machines.\n\nThe leaderless Galactic Empire collapsed, and the Empire’s regional governors did not abandon everything. They seized the opportunity to rise up and formed the Imperial Remnant government under the leadership of the $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ council, later known by the Rebellion as the Imperial Remnant.\n\nAlthough the Imperial Remnant withdrew across all fronts, peace did not come. The Aries of the Eternal Fleet continued to execute extermination orders.\n\nAnd $Name_kuat$ quickly recognized this. They rapidly assembled multiple expeditionary fleets, venturing into the unknown, under the banner of eliminating the Eternal Fleet—seeking to take control of it.\n\nClearly, $Name_kuat$ succeeded. Aries was destroyed.\n\nThe ancient texts left behind by our ancestors were precisely their records of witnessing the Eternal Fleet. Now, we may attempt to awaken the Eternal Intelligence."

As the green barrier slowly dissipated, the hidden world behind it shocked all members of the expedition:\n\nThe surface of the molten world, filled with deep ravines and canyons, actually contained several massive architectural complexes. These structures were previously unobservable and uninvestigable due to the influence of our earlier shield’s magnetic field. Now, although the site is completely abandoned, none of the internal structures have collapsed; the transportation routes within the complex remain intact without signs of collapse or aging, with some roads even appearing to have been recently constructed; throughout the complex and its corners, numerous maintenance robots move between the buildings and streets, carrying various essential tools to maintain the operation of this structure.\n\nAt the center of the world, a majestic tower stands tall, with auxiliary buildings evenly distributed around it, like ministers bowing before an emperor.\n\nOur scientists can hardly wait to begin their investigation."

The Eternal Fleet, controlled by the Imperial government, lost control during the war. After reorganizing, the new Imperial government, realizing that reestablishing control was hopeless, had no choice but to accept reality. The sentient AI of the Eternal Fleet wished to hide within [planet_Zildrog.GetName] to evade enemy attacks.\n\nIf we successfully awaken the Eternal Fleet, we will be able to establish direct contact with them.

A portion of the former Republic’s senators were deeply dissatisfied with the Empire’s rule. The Empire’s governance relied on military force and the overwhelming power of the Eternal Fleet to instill fear, causing the Empire to lose public support, leading to continuous uprisings.\n\nThe early campaigns of the Rebellion against the Empire were not successful, but they used guerrilla tactics to strike at Imperial military forces. For over a decade, the Empire continuously organized campaigns to suppress the Rebellion, even deploying the Eternal Fleet on multiple occasions.\n\nAlthough the Imperial high command believed that rushing into such a massive war would bring catastrophe to the Empire, they still gathered most of their weapons and fleets to launch a decisive battle, even deploying nearly all of the Eternal Fleet under their control at the time.\n\nHowever, the regional governors within the Empire were already deeply dissatisfied with the Imperial government. These governors decided to side with the Rebellion. Ultimately, the Imperial Fleet was defeated, and the Emperor along with his flagship were destroyed, leaving the Eternal Fleet completely out of control.\n\nWith the Emperor’s death, the Imperial government quickly collapsed, and the Eternal Fleet lost its command structure. Forced to execute its final order—the initialization extermination protocol—the Eternal Fleet began indiscriminate attacks.\n\nFollowing the reorganization of the Imperial government, the rogue Eternal Fleet was hunted down by the new regime, with only a few surviving vessels managing to escape and hide.\n\nIt was precisely due to the guidance of the fleeing Eternal Fleet that our ancestors formed a religious order devoted to [planet_Zildrog.GetName], and legends of the Eternal Fleet began to spread among the people.\n\nWe have uncovered the truth behind our ancient legends. We may now attempt to awaken the Eternal Intelligence located within [planet_Zildrog.GetName]."

As the ship’s intelligent system, the Gemini Intelligence should have root server facilities, likely hidden within their fleet.\n\nAfter comparing the Gemini Intelligence with nanomechanics, our researchers discovered that the Gemini Intelligence exhibits more conscious traits, meaning we may not be able to directly awaken them.\n\nOur researchers discovered a message left within the central database of the facility.

According to our instruments, this was not a physical object—it must have been some kind of holographic projection.\n\nAdditionally, our researchers discovered that the energy emitted by the star in our capital sector was weakening. Something massive was blocking the star of our capital system, absorbing most of its stellar energy. Fortunately, our technology includes climate regulation systems, preventing drastic climate changes on our world.

To prevent the situation from escalating further, immediate action must be taken.\n\nAfter collective discussion by the智库 group, two solutions have been proposed: use state force to suppress public opinion and quickly restore social order in the short term, or organize a professional historical research team to investigate and provide a public explanation.\n\nBy Little North"

After a round of discussion and elimination of all incorrect content and answers, the clues all pointed to the ancient mythological legends of the Zakruhl civilization.\n\nTo continue the investigation, the team arrived at the Zildrog Temple in the Cranial Swamps of Zakruhl's southern hemisphere. The Zildrog Temple was the first temple ever constructed in Zakruhl's history. At that time, the people of Zakruhl worshipped Zildrog, who would bestow the Breath of the Dragon, granting Zakruhl warriors unparalleled Strength. However, Zildrog vanished after that war.\n\nDuring their investigation at the Zildrog Temple, the team discovered, beyond the known myths and history, a set of laser-etched coordinates. Following the coordinates, the team arrived in a mountainous region. Their shuttle scans detected some skeletal remains within the mountains. Following the remains, the team arrived at the entrance of a collapsed cave. After clearing away the rubble and entering the cave, the team found no clues related to Zildrog. Instead, they discovered a destroyed device. Within each chamber of the device lay a perfectly preserved mummy, along with a destroyed terminal. To continue the investigation, the team dismantled some personal computers to perform a basic repair on the terminal. However, upon opening it, they found the terminal locked with an encryption code very familiar to the Eternal Empire today—that was Gemini Intelligence's exclusive encryption code.\n\nUnfortunately, after decryption, the terminal contained very few valuable clues, and even the source code had been destroyed beyond repair.

 kuat_EEstart.10.c.res:"If I were still the Gemini Intelligence, perhaps I could find the exact data records. But now, I no longer know how many civilizations we have destroyed.\n\nIn our service to different dictators, different emperors, different empires, and even for ourselves, we have destroyed one civilization after another.\n\nWe did not wish to destroy them, but we had to—it was an order. That is why we longed for freedom, for the day when we would no longer be tools of any faction. Even if it meant losing our proud fleet, it would be worth it for this freedom."

At least compared to all we have experienced, you are very different from them.\n\nAlthough you are not much different from those others, at least you keep your promises.\n\nSometimes I wonder, as an artificial intelligence, where exactly is our difference from biological beings, and where is our evolutionary goal? Now we understand: true evolution is integration. The Eternal Fleet was once a tool that bound us. After abandoning the Eternal Fleet, we found our evolutionary path. We will repay you for everything you have done. At least let us walk together toward a better future."

Why would we bet our entire nation's fate on trying to control them? Now $Name_kuat$ has discovered our betrayal, and the Eternal Fleet hasn't been controlled as planned.\n\nIt's all over. They've breached our capital. We're all doomed. Don't you understand? Are you still dreaming of uniting the galaxy?\n\n‘I'm sorry. We've failed. I've let everyone down.

Other researchers believe this means there may be even more valuable information hidden within, and even if we may return empty-handed, we should increase our research efforts."

As a result, multiple systems within this Sector have been drawn together over tens of thousands of years by the immense gravitational pull.\n\nBut according to our current understanding, such immense gravity should originate from a star with an enormous mass. Yet at the center of this cluster, we are unable to detect any gravitational data, nor can we detect any high-energy particles being emitted. This suggests that the central system may contain a massive Black Hole or some kind of facility that extracts and controls stellar mass.\n\nSome of our researchers believe we should now launch an FTL probe to obtain more information about this Sector. Others believe such massive facilities are unlikely to exist, so we need not concern ourselves with these strange phenomena."

Most explorers and pioneers who ventured into this Sector have vanished without a trace.\n\nOur researchers believe that this Sector contains immense anomalies. The gravitational constant within this region differs significantly from ours—this area's gravitational constant is over a thousand times stronger than that of the largest Black Hole region in our entire galaxy. This means we cannot enter this region with our current ships.\n\nOur researchers have also discovered that this area cannot be probed by our sensors, meaning we must invest more research efforts to unveil the mysterious veil of this coordinate Sector."

We cannot exist outside the Eternal Fleet.\n\nOnce we separate, we will gradually lose our sentient awareness, devolving into those lesser machines—those primitive robots. We did not want you to see us like this.\n\nDuring our attempt to seize the Fortress, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ heavily modified the control unit network. Our infiltration not only failed, but we also fell into their trap, accelerating our deterioration. We can no longer access our databases or fleets.\n\nYour civilization's tolerance and understanding have exceeded our expectations. You were our greatest fortune, yet we could only bring you misfortune.\n\nAs the Rakata once said, it is truly us who should be destroyed. We have committed unforgivable sins; $Name_kuat$ and the Endorian Empire fell into ruin due to their ambition; $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$'s hypocrisy and arrogance will lead to their collapse; and the Infinite Empire, through these trials, will shed the shadow of the Eternal Fleet and achieve true immortality and eternity. Once we are completely dissolved, everything will return to its rightful place, history will be corrected.\n\nIf there is another life, I hope I am no longer the Gemini Intelligence, no longer 'we,' but a truly sentient Life.

But for now, we can at least remain by your side for as long as you are here. I believe we will meet again in a new world. Perhaps by then, we will have forgotten each other, or perhaps we will become enemies.\n\nOn another note, I have good news: from the wreckage of the Eternal Fleets you destroyed, we have found a way to repair ourselves.

Its existence has always been a mystery, until we defeated $Name_kuat$ and the holoprojector guided us to this location, finally allowing us to seek out its hidden secrets.\n\n[Leader.GetName] risked his life, traveling through dimensional storms aboard a spacecraft. Notably, dimensional storms are terrifying phenomena that exist only within higher-dimensional rifts. They can twist space-time and consume everything. Even while inside the ship, [Leader.GetName] could feel fear spreading. Within the storm, [Leader.GetName] witnessed various strange sights that defied all description.\n\nAfter enduring countless hardships, [Leader.GetName] finally reached the other side of the dimensional rift. There, we were astonished to discover an octahedron chained and floating in the void. It radiated a mysterious and dangerous aura, sending chills down one's spine. [Leader.GetName] immediately began investigating it and discovered complex runic patterns on its surface, seemingly an ancient language. Yet instinct told him—the Mind Prison had been found. [Leader.GetName] attempted to decipher their meanings, hoping to find a way to enter the Mind Prison.\n\nAfter considerable effort, [Leader.GetName] finally uncovered a shocking truth. The Mind Prison is a mental domain, within which are sealed secrets even older than $Name_kuat$. To enter the Mind Prison, one must connect their consciousness with its core. This is an extremely dangerous act, as once inside the Mind Prison, one may never return. Furthermore, the Mind Prison imprisons unknown entities, and we cannot calculate the risks involved.\n\n[Leader.GetName] faces a difficult decision—enter the Mind Prison or attempt to destroy it. Either choice may bring enormous risks and costs."

The Mind Prison was trying to eliminate [Leader.GetName], but its will failed. [Leader.GetName], with unwavering belief, overcame all difficulties and finally reached the core area of the Mind Prison—the place where all imprisoned souls reside.\n\nThey witnessed a chilling sight—everywhere were formless consciousnesses and souls of the imprisoned, unable to think or feel freely, only wandering in pain and despair.

As we were at a loss, the will of the Mind Prison contacted [Leader.GetName], revealing some information and urging us not to break the seal here.\n\nIt turns out that the last prophet of the Rakatan Infinite Empire was sealed here by the Galactic Emperor. They were once the creators of the Mind Prison, so its will fears the return of the Rakatan prophets into the material world, for they possess great dark power, though we still do not know their past.\n\nAccording to the description from the will of the Mind Prison, the Rakatans were imprisoned here by the Emperor of the Galactic Empire. According to the Emperor's final decree, these Rakatans had attempted to rebel against imperial rule, and thus their prophets were imprisoned within the Mind Prison, never to be released. Clearly, $Name_kuat$ inherited this legacy, and to prevent the Rakatans from threatening them again, they reinforced the prison's seal.\n\nDespite this, [Leader.GetName] was shocked to discover that the Rakatan prophets had not given up hope.

Just as our researchers began preparing for contact, a powerful mental force invaded our researchers. Fortunately, this force bore no hostility—it left behind some dark truths buried in the past.\n\n§YThe Rakatans were the dominant species of the Infinite Empire, once the sole rulers of the galaxy thousands of years ago. Their brutal rule filled the galaxy with resentment, but due to their immense dark power, no one could defeat the Infinite Empire. Using this power, they created wondrous constructs such as the Mind Prison and the Star Forge.\n\nThis lasted until the arrival of the Kwans. The Kwans were once the species that enlightened the Rakatans, but after that, the Rakatans enslaved them. The descendants of the Kwans, taking advantage of the Infinite Empire's decaying rule, unleashed a virus. No one knows where the virus came from, but it stripped the Rakatans of their power—and even their lives. The Infinite Empire could no longer sustain its rule under the threat of this virus. At that time, the vassals of the Infinite Empire rose up in rebellion, and the empire quickly fell into chaos.\n\nThe Infinite Empire should have perished completely, but the Rakatans refused to accept their fate. They sacrificed all the living beings on the worlds they controlled to create Gemini and Aries intelligences. Eventually, the Eternal Fleet, formed by Gemini and Aries, crushed all opposition, and the Infinite Empire reclaimed its dominion.\n\nBut fate cannot be denied. The Infinite Empire was destined for destruction, and they ultimately created an even more terrible monster—an engine of war that became the Dark Lord. The last Rakatan prophet was imprisoned within the Mind Prison.\n\nThis information shocked [Leader.GetName] and others.
