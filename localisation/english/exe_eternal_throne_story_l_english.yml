 misc_system_desc_5_desc_finished: "Our research on $NAME_ag_kae_e_area$ has come to an end, and our researchers have discovered a lot of valuable information so far. \n\n$misc_system_desc_5$ is actually a star system that the Endodia Empire erased from the star map. Because the light emitted by its star is very weak, the Endodia Empire used its characteristics to make it a hidden military fortress. They concentrated all their military forces and economic and technical talents in this star system. In the last few years of their war with Kuat, this became the last control area of ​​the Endodia Empire. \n\nThe scan results of our researchers on this star system show that there are larger-scale ship wreckage in the star system than in the previous facility area. It seems that a larger-scale battle broke out between the Endodia Empire and $Name_kuat$ in $misc_system_desc_5$. According to estimates, the ships lost here have exceeded the upper limit of our known military power, but after the tragic battle, there are only ship wreckage and damaged giant structures everywhere. \n\nIn addition, according to our investigation report in the galaxy, the last emperor of the empire, Endodia I, made a deal with $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ here. They conspired to reach a certain agreement. Because of this agreement, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ prevented Kuat from killing the Endodia Empire. As a price, the emperor was also escorted to the control area of ​​$Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, and all the research data on isotope 5 conducted secretly by his empire was obtained by $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, so $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ has been guarding this fortress. It is not known what impact this situation will have on the Eternal Fleet, but we cannot take it lightly. \n\nFortunately, under the wise leadership of our imperial leader, we destroyed $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$'s guard fleet, restarted the stargate and obtained isotope 5, and our Eternal Fleet was repaired. However, under the coordinated operations of our fleet and the Eternal Fleet, the returning $Name_kuat$ was completely destroyed by us, and now they should no longer be arrogant. \n\nIn summary, we can confirm the following points:\n1.$misc_system_desc_5$ is the real last capital of the Endodia Empire and the place where they have been secretly researching the Eternal Fleet.\n2. The war between $Name_kuat$ and the Endodia Empire broke out completely under the intervention of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, and the Endodia Empire ended with its destruction.\n3.$Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ obtained research data on isotope 5 by ensuring the survival of the race of the Endodia Empire. It is currently uncertain what impact it will have on the Eternal Fleet.\n4. We can now be sure that we have completely defeated $Name_kuat$.\n\nBut the current situation is still confusing and we still need to continue investigating." #NT!

Our scientific team, who witnessed all this, immediately realized that there was some kind of equipment in this area that could confuse our visual, auditory and electronic signals, and immediately launched an EMP missile in order to overload all the electronic equipment here. \n\nIt turned out that their bet was right: a huge alien warship with a strange shape was docked in front of them." #NT!

The main structure of this battleship has a certain degree of damage, and the interior of the entire ship is also slightly dilapidated.

Because the gaps between the pipes are too narrow and rashly destroying the pipes may lead to extremely bad consequences, our team can only release micro drones to investigate the central core. \n\nIt turns out that our caution is correct: the center of the energy room is not a conventional material reactor at all, but a reactor powered by an artificial star body created by compressing energy to the extreme. After investigating its energy characteristics, we found that all the signals previously discovered started from it. \n\nDue to the special geographical characteristics of the planet itself and the interference of the camouflage position, the signal of the central star pile cannot be transmitted directly, and only a few signals that have escaped the double interference are left to echo in this starry sky. \n\nAfter receiving the investigation report, our chief sociology scientist said that the appearance of this facility named "Isotope-5 Reactor" is almost the same as the description of the battleship power in our legendary story." #NT!

 kuat_eternal_legacy.8.desc: "Just as our researchers were celebrating our victory, something unexpected happened. Our researchers who stayed behind discovered that the electronic control system of the ship was on the verge of collapse due to the impact of our previous EMP missile. \n\nThis directly caused the reaction in the center of the energy room to fall into an extremely unstable state during this period of time. Researchers speculated that due to the damage to the control system, the material transportation system of the entire ship may have been completely paralyzed, and the isotope-5 structure would fall into a dilemma of no more material to continue the energy release reaction due to the lack of external material injection, and would eventually self-disintegrate due to lack of fuel. \n\nSince the disintegration of the isotope-5 structure will change the gravity structure of the ship and eventually cause the collapse of the main structure, our researchers had to speed up the investigation of the secured part of the cabin. \n\nDuring our further investigation, we found some surviving paper documents, which greatly helped the progress of our language decryption team's project. \n\nAfter deciphering the basic properties and elements of the other party's language, our language translation team found that the intonation used in this unknown star warship is similar to the language used in our ancestors' era. But in terms of grammatical structure, theirs is much more complex. In addition, by retrieving data from the remaining data terminals, our scientific research team successfully mastered the basic structural characteristics of this ship driven by the isotope-5 structure, and obtained some research data related to the properties of the isotope-5 structure. \n\nAfterwards, due to the disappearance of the isotope-5 structure, except for the main cabin, most of the hull collapsed and disintegrated due to the loss of the maintenance field.

They quickly formed multiple expeditionary fleets and went deep into unknown areas, trying to control the Eternal Fleet in the name of destroying the Eternal Fleet. \n\nObviously, $Name_kuat$ succeeded and Aries was destroyed. \n\nThe ancient books left by our ancestors were recorded after they witnessed the Eternal Fleet.

Therefore, the Empire lost the support of the people and uprisings broke out one after another. \n\nThe rebels were not successful in their initial battles against the Empire, but they used guerrilla tactics to attack the Empire's military forces. The Empire continued to organize the elimination of the rebels during the war that lasted for more than ten years, and even used the Eternal Fleet at one time. \n\nAlthough the top leaders of the Empire believed that such a hasty war would bring disaster to the Empire, they still assembled most of their weapons and fleets to launch a battle, which even used almost all the Eternal Fleets controlled by the Empire at that time. \n\nHowever, the local governments within the Empire were actually dissatisfied with the behavior of the Imperial government. These local governors decided to stand with the rebels. In the end, the Imperial Fleet failed, the Imperial Emperor and his flagship were destroyed, and the Eternal Fleet was completely out of control. \n\nDue to the death of the emperor, the imperial government collapsed quickly, and the Eternal Fleet lost command and control.

Following the coordinates, the team came to a group of mountains, and the team's shuttle scanned some bones in the mountains. Following the skeleton team, they came to a collapsed cave. After clearing the rubble and entering the cave, the team did not find any clues about Zildrog. Instead, they found a destroyed instrument. In each compartment of the instrument, there was an uncorrupted dried corpse, and a destroyed terminal. In order to continue the investigation, the team dismantled some personal computers and made simple repairs to the terminal, but after opening it, they found that the terminal had been blocked by an encryption code that was very familiar to the Eternal Empire today.

Its existence has always been a mystery until we defeated $Name_kuat$ and the holocron led us here. Now we can find the secrets hidden in it. \n\n[Leader.GetName] risked his life and took the spaceship to cross the dimensional storm. It is worth noting that the dimensional storm is a terrible phenomenon that only exists in high-dimensional cracks. It can distort time and space and swallow everything. [Leader.GetName] can still feel the spread of fear even in the spaceship. In the storm, [Leader.GetName] saw all kinds of strange scenes that cannot be described in words. \n\nAfter experiencing countless hardships, [Leader.GetName] finally reached the other end of the dimensional crack. There, we were surprised to find an octahedron locked by chains, floating in the void. It exudes a mysterious and dangerous atmosphere that makes people shudder. [Leader.GetName] immediately began to investigate it and found that there were complex runes and patterns on its surface, which seemed to be an ancient language, but his intuition told him that the Mind Prison had been found. [Leader.GetName] tried to interpret their meanings, hoping to find a way to enter the Mind Prison. \n\nAfter some effort, [Leader.GetName] finally discovered an astonishing fact. The Mind Prison is a spiritual realm, and in the Mind Prison, there are secrets that are older than $Name_kuat$. To enter the Mind Prison, you need to connect your consciousness to the core of the Mind Prison. This is an extremely dangerous act, because once you enter the Mind Prison, you may never be able to return. Moreover, the Mind Prison imprisons unknown existences, and we cannot calculate the risks involved. \n\n[Leader.GetName] faces a difficult choice, whether to enter the Mind Prison or to crack and destroy the Mind Prison.

They could not think and feel freely, and could only wander in pain and despair. [Leader.GetName] found that these imprisoned souls had almost completely integrated into the Mind Prison." #NT!

When he was at a loss, the will of the Mind Prison contacted [Leader.GetName] and told us something, hoping that we would not destroy the blockade here. \n\nIt turned out that the last prophet of the Rakata Empire was sealed here by the Emperor of the Empire. They were once the creators of the Mind Prison. Therefore, the will of the Mind Prison is afraid of the Rakata prophets who return to the material world. They have powerful dark power, but we still don’t know their past. \n\nAccording to the description of the will of the Mind Prison, the Rakata people were imprisoned here by the Emperor of the Galactic Empire. According to the order issued by the last emperor, these Rakata people tried to resist the rule of the empire, so their prophets were imprisoned in the Mind Prison and could not be reborn forever. It was obvious that $Name_kuat$ inherited the legacy, and they strengthened the seal of the Mind Prison to prevent the Rakata from threatening their safety again.\n\nDespite this, [Leader.GetName] was surprised to find that the Rakata Prophets had not given up hope, and they had been waiting for an opportunity to retake everything they had." #NT!

Just as our researchers began to prepare to contact the prophet, a huge spiritual force invaded our researchers, but fortunately, this spiritual force was not hostile. He left behind some dark past events that were sealed in the past. \n\n§YThe Rakata people were the main species that established the Infinite Empire. They were the only rulers of the Milky Way a few years ago. Their brutal rule made the Milky Way complain, but because of their powerful dark force, no one could defeat the Infinite Empire. As a result, the Infinite Empire used the power they mastered to create miraculous creations such as the Mind Prison and the Star Furnace. \n\nUntil the appearance of the Kua people, the Kua people were once the enlightened race of the Rakata people, but after enlightenment, the Rakata people enslaved the Kua people. The descendants of the Kua people took advantage of the corruption of the Infinite Empire's rule and released a virus. No one knew where the virus came from. The virus made the Rakata people lose their power and even their lives. The rule of the Infinite Empire was unsustainable under the threat of the virus. It was at this time that the Infinite Empire's affiliates unveiled the banner of opposition to the Infinite Empire's rule. For a time, the Infinite Empire was torn apart, and the Milky Way was completely in turmoil. \n\nThe Infinite Empire should have been completely destroyed here, but the Rakata people were unwilling to perish. They sacrificed all the creatures that controlled the planet and created the Gemini and Aries intelligences. In the end, the Eternal Fleet formed by Gemini and Aries quelled all the waves against the Infinite Empire, and the Infinite Empire regained everything that belonged to them. \n\nBut destiny cannot be stopped. The Infinite Empire is bound to be destroyed. They eventually created a more terrifying monster and became the war machine of the Dark Lord, and the last Rakata prophet was imprisoned in the Mind Prison. \n\nThis information shocked [Leader.GetName] and others, and perhaps they should reconsider whether they should liberate this last Rakata prophet.

Just after [Leader.GetName] accessed, the space of the Mind Prison shook violently. Purple and golden light appeared above the empty sky. The two forces collided violently.
