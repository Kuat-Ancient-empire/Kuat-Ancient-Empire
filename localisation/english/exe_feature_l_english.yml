 kuat_support_celestic_storm_color_tooltip: "The special suppression position carried by the Vera Anchor is used to enhance the flagship's resistance to the Eternal Fleet and its own suppression effect. After deployment, it will cause a continuous special storm in an area to interfere with the Eternal Fleet, and the efficiency of the fleet's supply activities in the storm field will be improved." #NT!

 kuat_support_celestic_storm_aftermath_modifier_tooltip: "The supply area is used to increase the flagship effect and weaken the dynamic correction function. This mechanism is mainly for the Eternal Fortress and the Sky Fortress (that is, to encourage local defense operations). This mechanism has the following different effects:\n1. The supply area will increase the supply limit for the galaxies within the range. Within the supply limit, the super flagship fleet will gain 600% cycle gain in combat, the ordinary 1+2 flagship will gain 200% cycle gain, and the single flagship will gain 25% cycle gain. The output exceeding the upper limit is reduced to the basic flagship output level.\n2. The supply area has the function of recharging combat energy for the flagship fleet. After the flagship fleet is recharged, it can support 4 battles outside the supply area. Each battle reduces the total cycle gain by 25%, and the replenishment is completed within 60 days after returning to the supply area." #NT!
