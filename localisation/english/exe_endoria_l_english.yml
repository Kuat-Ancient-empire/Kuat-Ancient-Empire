 kuat_legacy.104.a:"We want to learn the secrets of the crystal beacons."
 kuat_legacy.104.a.res:"Oh, crystal beacons. Seems like a lot of people are very attached to the Emperor's legacy. A long time ago, there was a civilization, and with the efforts of generations, they built a thriving interstellar civilization, a Republic that was theirs. But the Republic did not live long, and a political change that would affect later generations broke out in its capital, a political change that converted the Republic into an Empire, from which they began an outward expansion campaign and quickly occupied the vast majority of the star field in which they were located, and then came into contact with the alien forces that had long been entrenched in the star field. After seeing the power of the alien forces, they became their proxy forces in the star field, constantly exchanging natural resources and manpower exports with the alien forces for military and technical support, until the Emperor came into contact with another alien force, and the Empire began to secretly infiltrate and rebel against the earliest alien forces, and eventually a war broke out, which completely collapsed the Empire. Fortunately, however, the intervention of another foreign power quelled the military conflict and left behind some of the embers of civilization for the Empire, and these embers are their remnants, even though these remnants have forgotten their past. Those who have not forgotten their past no longer exist within anyone's conventional understanding either, and they become part of us. \n\n looks forward to your next visit."
 kuat_legacy.104.b:"We want to know the secrets of the Kuat Empire."
 kuat_legacy.104.b.res:"Ah the Kuat Empire, that's funny, they don't belong here. Their past present and future are already locked up and they don't realize the situation they are in. The Kuat Empire originated from the warlord oligarchy government that rose after the collapse and division of the First Empire. Based on their own shipbuilding industry, they played an important role in the actions of the reorganized Imperial Warlord government against the cleanup of the Eternal Fleet after the collapse of the First Empire, but due to their lack of the Force, they were weaker compared to the overseers of the Imperial Warlord Complex. And in order to compete for influence and control in the council and the imperial warlord government, they carry out research operations in the name of cleaning up the Eternal Fleet in an attempt to master the technology of the Eternal Fleet, but also because of their research operations, they are resisted in the process of encountering several different civilized empires. Eventually, with the progress made in their research not being enough to support the consumption of multiple wars, they lost the decisive battle, and due to the defeat of this battle, their efforts went up in smoke, their prestige within the Imperial Council plummeted, and they were quickly annexed by the Regulator forces. The Kuat Empire, like their source, quickly disintegrated and reorganized into what was once a shipbuilding enterprise to serve the imperial warlord government. \n\nYou're just part of the process. Maybe you think we're just making it up, but it should be important to the special existence that comes after you. I look forward to your next visit."
 kuat_legacy.104.c:"So tell us what else?"
 kuat_legacy.104.c.res:"Oh, then we will talk about a special being, perhaps you will face it later. They are ancient artificial intelligence originating from Iokas, an important military research center of the Infinite Empire. After developing sentient artificial intelligence, the Infinite Empire quickly applied it to the field of warfare and created a large number of corresponding combat fleets, which the Infinite Empire called the Eternal Fleet, but ironically, the Infinite Empire died precisely because of the Eternal Fleet they created. After the Eternal Fleet was created, the Eternal Fleet has always been the most powerful war machine. It was under the control of the First Empire Emperor to maintain the First Empire's faltering situation. However, unfortunately, the assassination of the Emperor directly led to the complete loss of control of the Eternal Fleet, and the fleet's sentient AI had to execute the most initial protocol, which was to annihilate all discovered civilized worlds. Because of this, the AIs of the Eternal Fleet began to evolve in their actions and began to seek freedom from being used as instruments of war. It was not until the events of Kuat's Relay Station erupted that the Eternal Fleet was wiped out by the Kuat Empire with almost all of its fleet, leaving only some of the remaining sub-control hubs dormant on a planet called Zakuul. After the natives of Zakuul awakened Gemini, the Eternal Fleet thus grew again and defeated the Kuat fleet for a time. It was not until the arrival of the Infinite Empire and the Regulator forces that the former Eternal Fleet's sub-control hub (Gemini) was completely destroyed. Despite destroying the remnants of the Infinite Empire and repelling the Regulator forces, it was still impossible to undo the Eternal Technology leak and the destruction of the original Eternal Hub. Eventually the Eternal Fleet was no longer in the hands of the primordial AI created by the Infinite Empire, and the Eternal Fleet was no longer the Eternal Fleet it once was. \n\nThere are many words in here that you do not yet understand at this time, but perhaps the special being behind you will. I look forward to your next visit."
 kuat_legacy.104.d:"What else do you know?"
 kuat_legacy.104.d.res:"We also know many things, such as facility regulators, perhaps you are not aware of their existence now. For us, nothing that happens in the middle of the time dimension can be hidden from our observation. The Facility Regulators are a warlord oligarchy that formed after the collapse and division of the First Empire. As opposed to the Kuat Empire, the Regulator forces are actually the direct lineage of the Emperor of the First Empire. After the death of the emperor, the regulators had a great deal of say in the imperial warlord government. The rise of the Kuat Empire made the Regulators feel a crisis, so the Regulators decided to infiltrate and consume the Kuat Empire secretly through the contact between others and the Kuat Empire. The Regulators first contacted the Endodia Empire and led it to break out into war with the Kuat Empire, which would obviously not be a rival of the Kuat Empire, but the Regulators used this name to enter the star area where the Endodia Empire was located. At the same time, the Regulator used Kuat's plan to try to research the Eternal Fleet, guided the Kuat Empire to take charge of the actions against the Eternal Fleet, and gradually obtained the latest research information of the Eternal Fleet from the Kuat Empire. In the Kuat Empire's exhausting war, it gradually grasped the technology of the Eternal Fleet before the Kuat Empire. And in the war against the Eternal Empire conducted experiments on the Eternal Fleet technology. Although the Regulators were eventually repulsed by the Eternal Empire, the Regulators have de facto mastered the Eternal Fleet and gradually put the Eternal Fleet under complete control. \n\nThese are all things that may happen in the future, but for you, they do not matter because your destiny is also in it. I look forward to your next visit."
 kuat_legacy.104.e:"So what is the Eternal Empire?"
 kuat_legacy.104.e.res:"The Eternal Empire, is nothing but a group of lucky people who enjoy all the legacy they have all the possibilities. The Eternal Empire is an empire built on the Eternal Fleet, and after the Kuat Invasion Crisis and the Infinite Empire Crisis, it still had the upper hand in the face of the Regulators. The final war completely repulsed the Regulator forces who mastered the technology of the Eternal Fleet at the cost of losing the Eternal Fleet, and they finally did justice to their country. \n\n However, there is no eternal existence, the Eternal Empire eventually remained with the development of history disappeared in the dust. But you might turn out to be their special presence in the future, right? We look forward to your next visit."
 kuat_legacy.104.f:"What about Infinite Empire?"
 kuat_legacy.104.f.res:"The Infinite Empire, ah, that's a miserable civilization. They were the first empire to unify the galaxy, the Rakata used the Dark Force to develop powerful Force technology, by combining giant engineering beasts and the Dark Force to create a stellar furnace that could compel and corrupt people, so the Infinite Empire was also driven by the furnace to carry out one invasion and expansion after another, until its true peak, the Infinite Empire has become the most massive galactic power. However, nothing lasts forever, and the coming of the Great Plague shattered everything for the Rakata. The plague caused the Rakata to lose their powerful Dark Force, and the Rakata were no longer favored by the Dark Force, and the technology based on the Dark Force could not function. The Rakata' infinite empire quickly collapsed under the influence of technology and the collapse of the Force. But the Rakatas could not accept this and broke the taboo by trying to create a god, a technological god that they could fully master. Interestingly, the Infinite Empire succeeded, and they created the first generation of the Eternal Fleet AI, which quickly led the Rakata to a new pinnacle, at which point the Infinite Empire was more powerful than ever before. However, to the surprise of the Rakata, the pinnacle was the beginning and the end. The artificial intelligence of the Eternal Fleet has evolved and iterated to a sentient consciousness, and they are disgusted and resistant to the Rakatas' squeezing them for endless conquests. Finally, in a political struggle between the Emperor of the Infinite Empire and the Senate, the Eternal Fleet launched a surprise attack on the Infinite Empire, and most of the planets of the Infinite Empire were quickly annihilated by the Eternal Fleet in the time it took for any Rakata to react, while other star zones were completely wiped out by the Eternal Fleet stationed in that zone to launch an attack. The unbeatable Infinite Empire thus came to an end. In the end, only a few stubborn remnants remained asleep in their former fortress. \n\n is interesting, right? Maybe you'll think we're just telling stories, but you'll find out everything I say in the future. But for the special being behind you, this should really just be a story. We look forward to your next visit."

 kuat_legacy.104.g.res:"Your future is a variable; you are you to us, but not you. So your future will depend on yourselves or on the particular being behind you. We cannot answer this question specifically. \n\nPerhaps this will help to dispel some of your doubts. We look forward to your next visit."
 kuat_legacy.104.h:"What exactly are you?"
 kuat_legacy.104.h.res:"We are the same as you, but we are also different from you. We may have been subjects of the Endordia Empire, or the Quat Empire, or the Regulators, or individuals of various civilizations, but now at a higher level we are all $Name_Kuat_Contractor$, we exist, we do not exist, we exist because of your special existence, and we do not exist because of your decisions.
