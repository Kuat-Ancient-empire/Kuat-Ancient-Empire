But since we have not obtained information about the lost empire, it may be related to them. But as far as the reaction results are concerned, this cannot be the damage caused by the army's battle. The structure of the entire ring is basically in an unstable equilibrium state, and this ring section may collapse at any time. \n\nBut when studying these peculiar energy responses, [leader.GetName] found that the tachyonic signals received by the instrument were very similar to those energy signals that were transformed through a 7200 periodic law. The place where the signal is strongest is a peculiar spire building.

The internal structure of the entire minaret is very complicated and seems to be the arrangement of a certain defense system, but it seems that because the ruins have been severely damaged, these remaining defense systems are completely ineffective. Even a large number of defensive facilities seem to have been destroyed by some kind of weapon, and it does not look like a trace of aging. \n\n[leader.GetName] and her research team walked around the complex ancient minaret ruins like a maze for a long time, and finally found a closed gate, which was completely covered by dust In its original appearance, it was impossible to even force open the door.

The comparison of the energy information flow from the signal source is still different. There should still be some secrets hidden after the ruins. [leader.GetName] decided to take her team to move on. Her keen sense and the results of the data analysis here told her that there should be something different here. \n\nWith the efforts of the scientific research team, there is a huge energy response under the server group in the laboratory, and this energy is very similar to the effect of our data signal flow after periodic transformation. [leader.GetName] and her team found a slightly sunken stone on a stone wall on the back of the server group. At the moment she pressed it down, the server group seemed to be affected by some kind of gravity following the vibration of the ruins.

After going deep into the temple, our scientific research team discovered that the internal structure here has changed a lot. The dilapidation on the outside may be used to conceal some of the important secrets. It is also possible that it has only gradually become abolished in wars and disrepair.

In desperation, we can only temporarily write a prize-winning game, program all the topics into the game content, and call on people of insight across the country to solve the problems together without revealing the secrets. \n\nIt is said that [leader.GetName] once complained to team members during a break after solving a problem: 'It seems to be back to the painful and happy student age'."

This so-called Star Gate is exactly the mysterious ring-shaped star gate we discovered during interstellar exploration. The document mentioned that this portal was built by an extremely powerful alien civilization in ancient times and was locked by an extremely complex special code. However, in a certain war, the empire in its heyday discovered a way to unlock the Stargate from a captured data facility and kept a record of it. In that battle, the battlefield situation became increasingly unfavorable due to the sharp decline of the imperial power. At a critical juncture, in order to let future generations know the reason for everything, in order to allow future generations to have the opportunity to touch this dusty secret, the empire's senior officials will keep this secret in this place forever after all the empire they know will be destroyed. Finally, it is the most confidential refuge, and all the knowledge that can be helpful to future generations is preserved here. \n\n At the end of the file, It wrote: 'It is destined to find strangers here.
