Moreover, the atmosphere and storms of this gaseous planet are not distributed like the storms of ordinary gaseous planets. The storms of this planet seem to have been surrounding the huge floating building in the center. \n[leader.GetName] decided to go to this floating building. Upon arrival, [leader.GetName] found that this floating building was very large, and there were a large number of densely distributed residential buildings on the building, but according to the life scan, there was no life information, and these buildings seemed to be temporary The temporary buildings built are average, maybe this floating building is a floating city. \n\n His team led by [leader.GetName] landed on the floating city and found that the city seemed to have only one existing landing platform. After landing, our [leader.GetName] found that it seemed to be used on the ground. I wrote "Welcome to the Cloud City Refuge Area" in a language similar to mine, and the tower-shaped building in the center of the Cloud City can be clearly seen in the distance.

When [leader.GetName] went deep into the central tower of Cloud City, he found that there seemed to be a mysterious computer device in the basement of the central tower. This device was very similar to the computer facilities we commonly used. The moment she turned on the computer, an image of a beautiful girl appeared on the screen:\n\n§YHello, outsiders, maybe when you saw this image, we had disappeared. But this is not important. We don’t care who you are or what your purpose is, but I believe that the information we leave will protect you and this galaxy. We are the builders of this cloud city refuge and database. Our empire is about to die. We may also disappear from this universe or be reset by memory. We don’t know if they will let us go, and we don’t know ours. Are your compatriots well now? The enemy's patrol fleet is already close to this refuge. You should be wondering what the enemy is, but it doesn’t matter. Our empire was once prosperous. Our empire relied on military industry and technology quickly became a galaxy. The most powerful force, but insatiable and ambition eventually destroyed us. We signed a joint defense and research agreement with an ancient civilization. With the help of the agreement, we purchased and introduced a large number of advanced ship production lines and technologies. But..........§!\n\nThe image came to an abrupt end here, it seems that it has suffered some irreversible loss because it has been stored for too long, and the subsequent images cannot be displayed normally... ...But at least we can get some information about ancient civilizations here.

The team of scientists [leader.GetName] is ready to go inside. \n\nThe report transmitted after our research team had successfully entered the facility, the ancient and massive complex was in an extreme state of silence. The scientist [leader.GetName] can't even detect any transmission here.

Although our scientists smoothly into the shades of central system, only to find that there is no any store data, any information and ruins of the building were deliberately erased, but our scientists [leader.GetName] should think the civilization is the first few ruins the building of the civilization, the ancient civilization seems to escape...

During this period, our researchers have not given up on searching for the reason why the ring can maintain the gravitational environment of the black hole. At present, our researchers have made preliminary judgments. Black holes are not congenital, but acquired, because the gravity of the black hole here is not the same as what we have encountered in the previous star field. Perhaps this is the reason why this ring can exist. \n\nThe environment of the ring is very habitable after restoration, but according to the analysis of the city ruins and facility debris on the ring, it was once a war supply point for that ancient civilization, but who is the enemy, we still unknown. But this star field suffered severe damage. \n\n§YOur scientific researchers discovered some tower-like buildings, but these towering buildings were not found when we explored the ring. Maybe we should study in depth..."

This is a strong defense fortress, and the center of the galaxy was not a black hole. The black hole was a super controlled by the ancient civilization. It was formed by the collapse of the star caused when the weapon was destroyed, but the ancient civilization did not know what method was used to avoid the collapse of the ring. And this star field seems to be at the time that the ancient civilization was at war with a mysterious force outside the Galaxy. The ancient civilization was unable to resist them. It detonated their ancient war fortress that came back from the civilization outside the river, hoping to completely destroy the enemy in this system. fleet. Unfortunately, this did not destroy their enemies, but ruined the fortress galaxy and their last resistance base. §!\N\nFortunately, the information in the ancient database in the ring is still well preserved.
