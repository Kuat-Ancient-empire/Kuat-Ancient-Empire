  ag_kae_oc_invasion_chain_title:0 "$Name_Kuat_Fire_base$’s Wrath!"
  ag_kae_oc_invasion_chain_desc:0 "Since the secrets of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ were exposed, their ugly faces have been revealed to the entire galaxy. They went to any lengths to scheme against $Name_kuat$, and ultimately we delivered the final blow to their failed strategy.\n\nThe hypocritical $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will not give up easily. They are about to launch a full-scale offensive on our star system. Any possibility of avoiding war has been completely eliminated. Now it’s time for us to send them back."

  ag_kae_e_area_arc_site_project_1: "§EReanchor the Jumpgate§!"
  ag_kae_e_area_arc_site_project_1_DESC: "By rearranging the navigation coordinates of the jumpgate using the isotope 5 we obtained from the Endoradia ruins, we can expect this to significantly weaken the $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ fleet that will arrive in our star system in the future. Then, it will be the moment for us to face off against $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ in the final battle."

  kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.24.desc:0 "Oh, oh, you truly are a surprise. We chose you because of your past, when your ancestors, the Endoradia Empire, fell at the hands of $Name_kuat$. It was we who allowed you to continue, and yet you betrayed us, aiding $Name_kuat$.\n\nThe support we provided was more than enough to bring you back to your former glory, even surpassing your ancestors. Since you do not cherish this, we will show you the consequences of betraying the Watchers."
  kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.24.accept:0 "We just don’t want to be your puppets."
  kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.24.accept.res:0 "That’s just an excuse for your despicable actions. In the face of profit, such dignity is laughable.\n\nDo you still think $Name_kuat$ will save you? This farce should end now."

  kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.25.title:0 "$Name_Kuat_StarContractor$"
  kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.25.desc:0 "Long time no see, we meet again. These impolite people have occupied our territory for so long, it’s really annoying, but it feels much better now that we’ve cleared them out.\n\nYou don’t look too good. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will soon use the Starkiller Base to destroy you. You’re lucky that $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ is very interested in you, or rather, in “you.” So, as long as you’re willing to pay a price, we can prevent this. Such a good deal is rare."
  kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.25.accept:0 "We’ll make the deal."
  kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.25.accept.res:0 "Delicious. We have already warped this star system. Now, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$’s base will not be able to lock onto this location. There is another $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ base hidden in this star domain. Dealing with it might give you a fighting chance."

  kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.26.title:0 "$Name_Kuat_StarContractor$"
  kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.26.desc:0 "You are truly remarkable. Your execution efficiency is unprecedented!\n\nHowever, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ is coming. Don’t die. It’s been a long time since something this interesting has happened."
  kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.26.accept:0 "We won’t die."

  ag_kae_ge_invasion.102.a.desc:0 "The Imperial Research Department has captured a strange signal band. This signal band has a certain degree of irregular frequency characteristics, which is completely different from what we have encountered before. Our researchers found that this band is emitted by a star system we have never discovered on the star map.\n\nAs $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ predicted, we have found $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$’s garrison star system. Defense Department officials claim that if we do not strike first, we will be at a disadvantage in the upcoming retaliation from $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$."

  ag_kae_ge_invasion.110.a.desc:0 "§H[Root.GetName]§! After traversing the hyperspace route, arrived in a peculiar domain. There are no normal stars within the entire §H[From.GetName]§! and it is littered with the wreckage of various spacecraft.\n\nAt the center of §H[From.GetName]§!, §H[Root.GetName]§! detected an artificial gravity well with a radius exceeding 600 AU. It appears to originate from a massive, damaged stargate structure at the center of the star. Around the stargate, there are numerous damaged star rings encircling the central megastructure. These rings are completely destroyed, and none of them seem to be functional. Meanwhile, our reconnaissance personnel have discovered that the concentrated $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ fleet in this star system has not yet received any communications from $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, and they have not yet attacked us. This is a good opportunity for us to strike first."

  ag_kae_ge_invasion.114.a.desc:0 "Your little insects actually dared to betray us. Now, you will face our wrath. We will use our fleet to reduce your core worlds to rubble, and your species will forever be a lowly one."

  ag_kae_ge_invasion.120.a.desc:0 "Damn, why do these natives have such a fleet? Don’t think that with the support of those merchants, you can defeat us. When the jumpgate reactivates, your star domain, your empire, and your civilization will all be wiped out by us."

  ag_kae_ge_invasion.126.a.desc:0 "Our researchers successfully entered the central spire, and they found that over time, the internal structure of the spire has been severely damaged. The intricate defense systems and robots inside the spire are no longer functional, which greatly facilitated the investigation by our research team.\n\nOur researchers very quickly located the central data storage facility of the ruins. Through a series of methods, they successfully unlocked the data storage facility and discovered some surprising data.\n\nAfter decrypting the database, we successfully found the key to resealing the jumpgate. We can use the remaining isotope 5 to re-anchor the jumpgate’s address, thereby limiting the naval tonnage that can pass through the jumpgate. This will minimize the number of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ fleets that can reach us."

  ag_kae_ge_invasion.130.a.desc:0 "The jumpgate in [ag_kae_e_area_system.GetName] has been successfully anchored. Now, the main forces of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will not be able to normally pass through the jumpgate to reach our star system. They will not be able to deploy a large number of naval fleets to our star domain.\n\nThen, the initiative in this war will be in our hands, and we will have the advantage of fighting on our home ground."

  ag_kae_ge_invasion.131.a.desc:0 "As $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ said, the arrival of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ is inevitable. We must deal with the threat from $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ as soon as possible. These fools do not yet know that we have completed the redirection of the jumpgate. No fleet exceeding our tolerance limit can enter our star system.\n\nThe redirection cannot last much longer. Now is the time when the jumpgate rules are at their strongest. It’s time for us to lure them into a trap. Repair the jumpgate and send them on their final journey."

  ag_kae_ge_invasion.132.a.desc:0 "Our research department discovered a new jumpgate through astronomical observations. We should quickly organize our fleet to investigate this area. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ is likely to establish a base here and launch an attack against us."

  ag_kae_ge_invasion.132.b:0 "Prepare the fleet."

  ag_kae_oc_invasion_secondary_portal_poi:0 "§EJumpgate§!"
  ag_kae_oc_invasion_secondary_portal_poi_desc:0 "The jumpgate is a special interstellar navigation tool that $Name_kuat$ created using research on isotope 5 from the Eternal Fleet. They can rapidly deploy military forces through the jumpgate. Now, they are controlled by $Name_Kuat_Contractor$, and clearly, $Name_kuat$ cannot stop their plundering. If we want to defeat them, we must destroy the jumpgate!"

  ag_kae_ge_invasion.213.a.desc:0 "Our research department discovered a new jumpgate through astronomical observations. We should quickly organize our fleet to investigate this area. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ is likely to establish a base here and launch an attack against us."

  ag_kae_ge_invasion.217.b:0 "I hope this is the last one."

  ag_kae_ge_invasion.220.a.desc:0 "Under our meticulous planning, the invasion of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ has been completely crushed. These hypocritical bandits will never defeat us. If $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ is right, our star domain will be completely sealed off, and $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will never be able to defeat us. Although our power is still insufficient now, with enough time, the future can still be ours.\n\n$Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ failed due to arrogance, and we must not repeat their mistakes. The new Endoradia Empire will begin from here."
