 ag_kae_oc_invasion_chain_title:0 "$Name_Kuat_Fire_base$§E's Wrath§!"
 ag_kae_oc_invasion_chain_desc:0 "Since the dirty secrets of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ were exposed, their ugly faces have been fully revealed to the entire galaxy. They spared no effort to scheme against $Name_kuat$, and now we have delivered the final blow to their strategic failure.\n\nThe hypocritical $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will never back down. They are about to launch a full-scale attack on our star systems. Any possibility of avoiding war has now completely vanished. It's time for us to send them back where they belong."

 ag_kae_e_area_arc_site_project_1:"§ERealign the Jump Gateway§!"
 ag_kae_e_area_arc_site_project_1_DESC:"By using the isotope 5 we obtained from the Endodia ruins, we can rearrange the navigation address of the Gateway. It is expected that this will greatly weaken the $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ fleets that will arrive in our star system in the future. Then, it will be the time for our final showdown with $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$."


 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.24.desc:0 "Well well well, you truly surprised us. We chose you in the first place because of your past. Long ago, your ancestors, the Endodia Empire, were destroyed by $Name_kuat$. It was us who allowed you to continue, yet you,竟然 betrayed us to help $Name_kuat$.\n\nThe support we gave you was more than enough to bring you back to your peak, even surpassing your ancestors. Since you do not value all this, then we will show you what happens to those who betray the Watchers."
 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.24.accept:0 "We simply refuse to be your puppets."
 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.24.accept.res:0 "This is merely an excuse for your despicable actions. In the face of interests, such dignity is nothing but ridiculous.\n\nDo you still dare to hope that $Name_kuat$ will save you? This farce has gone on long enough. It's time to end it."

 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.25.title:0 "$Name_Kuat_StarContractor$"
 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.25.desc:0 "Long time no see, we meet again. These impudent beings have occupied our territory for far too long, which is truly infuriating. But just now, I've cleaned things up a bit. Much better.\n\nYou seem to be in a rather bad state. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will soon deploy the Death Star Base to destroy you. You're quite lucky, though. $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ is very interested in you. Oh no, interested in 'you'. Therefore, if you are willing to pay a certain price, we can prevent all of this. Such a favorable deal doesn't come around often."
 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.25.accept:0 "We accept the deal."
 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.25.accept.res:0 "Delicious. We have already distorted this star system, and now the base of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will no longer be able to lock onto this location. Hidden within this sector is another base of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$. Destroy it, and perhaps you still have a sliver of hope for survival."

 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.26.title:0 "$Name_Kuat_StarContractor$"
 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.26.desc:0 "Not bad at all. I knew you could do it. You found [ag_kae_e_area_system.GetName] so quickly. This was once a glorious civilization—and quite fittingly, it was part of your own past. But that was so long ago. You are not truly them anymore.\n\nBut since you've come this far, as long as you are willing to pay the price, we can offer you a better chance at survival. Such a favorable deal doesn't come around often."
 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.26.accept:0 "Then how should we deal with $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$?"
 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.26.accept.res:0 "Very good. Do you see the Jump Gateway at the center of this sector? The isotope 5 here can be used to realign it. The $Name_kuat$ you helped earlier shut down all the pathways leading here before they left. All you need to do is redirect the Jump Gateway of the entire star system. Then, most of the fleets of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will no longer be able to locate your position. And a weakened $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will be much easier to deal with.\n\nAs long as you execute this successfully, everything will end. I must say, 'you' really are fascinating."

 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.27.title:0 "$Name_Kuat_StarContractor$"
 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.27.desc:0 "You truly are fascinating. Such high operational efficiency is unheard of!\n\nHowever, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ is coming. Don't die now. It's been a long time since anything this interesting has happened."
 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.27.accept:0 "We won't die."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.102.a.desc:0 "The imperial research department intercepted a strange signal frequency. This signal possesses irregular frequency characteristics to a certain degree, completely different from anything we have encountered before. Our researchers, through in-depth study, discovered that this frequency originates from a star system that has never before appeared on our star charts.\n\nAs expected by $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$, we have located the garrison star system of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$. Defense officials claim that if we do not strike first, we will be placed at a disadvantage when facing retaliation from $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ in the near future."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.110.a.desc:0 "§H[Root.GetName]§! entered a strange region after crossing the hyperlane. The entire §H[From.GetName]§! contains no normal stars, only scattered wreckage of various spacecraft.\n\nAt the center of §H[From.GetName]§!, §H[Root.GetName]§! detected an artificial gravity well with a radiation radius exceeding 600AU. It likely originates from a massive, damaged Gateway structure located at the heart of the star system. Surrounding the Gateway structure, numerous peculiar damaged rings orbit around the central colossal ring structure. These rings are completely destroyed, and after scanning, none appear to be operational. Meanwhile, our reconnaissance personnel discovered that the concentrated $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ fleet in this star system seems to have not yet received information from $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, and they have not yet launched an attack on us. This is our perfect opportunity to strike first."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.114.a.desc:0 "You insignificant insects dare to betray us? Then prepare yourselves to face our wrath. We will use our fleets to reduce your core worlds to rubble, one by one, and reduce your species to nothing more than an inferior race."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.120.a.desc:0 "Damn it, how dare you primitives possess such fleets? Don't think that just because you have the support of those merchants, you can defeat us. When the Gateway is reactivated, your sector, your empire, and your entire civilization will be completely erased by us."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.126.a.desc:0 "After our researchers successfully entered this faintly visible central spire, they discovered that its internal structure had been severely damaged over time, including some of the precision defensive instruments and robots inside the tower, which can no longer function properly. This provided great assistance to our research team's investigation.\n\nOur researchers quickly located the central database storage facility of the ruins. Through a series of methods, they successfully unlocked the facility and discovered some astonishing data.\n\nAfter decrypting the database, our researchers successfully found the key to resealing the Jump Gateway. By utilizing the residual isotope 5, we can realign the Gateway address and thereby limit the naval tonnage that can pass through. This will significantly reduce the number of fleets arriving from $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.130.a.desc:0 "The Jump Gateway in [ag_kae_e_area_system.GetName] has been successfully realigned. Now, the main forces of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will no longer be able to reach our star system normally. They will be unable to deploy large fleets into our sector.\n\nAt that point, the initiative in this war will be entirely in our hands. Fighting on home ground, the advantage is ours."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.131.a.desc:0 "As $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ said, the arrival of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ is inevitable. We must eliminate the threat from $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ as soon as possible. These fools still don't know that we have already completed the redirection of the Jump Gateway. Any fleet exceeding our tolerance threshold will be unable to enter our star system.\n\nThe redirection cannot be maintained for much longer. Now is the time when the Gateway's rules are at their strongest. Now is the time to lure them in. Repair the Jump Gateway, and send them off for the final time."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.132.a.desc:0 "Our researchers have successfully completed the repair of the Jump Gateway. According to our isotope 5 signal receiver, the activation of the Gateway quickly drew attention from the other side.\n\nThis means our plan's first step has succeeded. Now, we simply wait for the prey to walk into our trap."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.202.a.desc:0 "Our intelligence department intercepted a series of strong tachyon signals being transmitted from outside the star system. Astronomical observations indicate that the exact source of the signal cannot currently be measured, but our observations seem to suggest that it originates from the Jump Gateway in our $NAME_ag_kae_e_area$ sector. We are still unable to decipher the content of this signal, but undoubtedly, it must be a sign that the $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ fleet is about to arrive."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.203.a.desc:0 "Recent astronomical observations indicate unusual energy activity at the Jump Gateway in the $NAME_ag_kae_e_area$ sector we occupy. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ is coming."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.204.a.desc:0 "Recently, our intelligence department intercepted a series of hyperspace currents. The fleets of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ are rapidly approaching our star system through some artificial one-way hyperlane connected to our Jump Gateway. Their arrival is imminent. Based on their trajectory, the great war of life and death is about to begin."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.205.a.desc:0 "Recent astronomical observations indicate unusual energy activity at the Jump Gateway in the $NAME_ag_kae_e_area$ sector under our control. Compared to the last time, the $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ fleet is making even more noise. Our soldiers must be prepared."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.206.a.desc:0 "The first wave of extragalactic fleets has entered the gravity well of the $NAME_ag_kae_e_area$ sector under our control and is now orbiting around its center. Additional fleets will soon arrive. So far, they have not responded to any of our communications, and their behavior has not yet indicated hostility. As $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ predicted, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ has finally arrived in our star system. Fortunately, our plan is proceeding smoothly. The redirection of the Jump Gateway has prevented a large number of advanced fleets from $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ from arriving. Now, we only need to deal with these insignificant remnants to permanently drive them away."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.207.a.desc:0 "You damned inferior race! You dare to plot against us? Do you really think that with the secret support of $Name_kuat$, you can defeat us?\n\nYou are nothing but our puppets. To dare to rebel means you will die without even a grave.\n\nI must say, $Name_kuat$ actually helped you shut down the other Jump Gateways, but what good will that do? They will suffer the harshest punishment, and as for you, your only fate is destruction."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.212.a.desc:0 "Our research departments have discovered a new jump gateway through astronomical observation. We should quickly organize a fleet to investigate the area. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will likely launch an attack from there and establish a base."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.212.b:0 "Prepare the fleet."

 ag_kae_oc_invasion_secondary_portal_poi:0 "§EJump Gateway§!"
 ag_kae_oc_invasion_secondary_portal_poi_desc:0 "The Jump Gateway is a special interstellar navigation device created by $Name_kuat$ through their research on isotope 5 from the Eternal Fleet. They can rapidly deploy military forces through the Jump Gateway. Now, they are controlled by $Name_Kuat_Contractor$, and clearly, $Name_kuat$ can no longer stop their acts of plunder. Now, it is up to us alone. If we wish to defeat them, we must destroy the Jump Gateway!"

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.213.a.desc:0 "Our research departments have discovered a new jump gateway through astronomical observation. We should quickly organize a fleet to investigate the area. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will likely launch an attack from there and establish a base."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.217.b:0 "Let's hope this is the last one."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.220.a.desc:0 "Through our meticulous planning, the invasion by $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ has been completely crushed. These hypocritical raiders will never overcome us. If what $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ says is true, our sector will soon be completely sealed off. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will never defeat us. Our strength is still insufficient now, but with enough time, the future may yet be ours. \n\n$Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ failed due to arrogance, and we must never repeat that mistake. A new Empire of Endodia will begin from here."
