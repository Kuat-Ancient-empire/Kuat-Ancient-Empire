 ag_kae_oc_invasion_chain_desc:0 "Our research department has discovered a new jump gate through astronomical observation. We should quickly organize a fleet to investigate the area. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will likely attempt to establish a base there and launch an attack against us."

 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.27.desc:0 "Since the shameful secrets of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ were exposed, their ugly faces have been fully revealed to the entire galaxy. They spared no effort to scheme against $Name_kuat$, and ultimately we delivered the final blow to their strategic failure.\n\nThe hypocritical $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will never give up easily. They are about to launch a full-scale attack on our galaxy, and any possibility of avoiding war has now completely vanished. Now it's time for us to send them back."
 kuat_fallen_mission_reaction.27.accept:0 "§ERealign the Jump Gate§!"

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.102.a.desc:0 "By using the Isotope 5 obtained from the ruins of Endodia, we have rearranged the navigation address of the jump gate. It is expected that this will greatly weaken the fleets of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ arriving in our galaxy in the future. At that time, it will be the moment for our decisive battle with $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.110.a.desc:0 "Well well well, you truly surprised us. We chose you back then because of your past—your ancestors, the Endodia Empire, were destroyed by $Name_kuat$. It was us who allowed you to continue, and yet you,竟然 betrayed us and helped $Name_kuat$.\n\nThe support we gave you was more than enough to bring you back to greatness, even surpassing your ancestors. Since you do not value all this, then we shall show you the fate of those who betray the Watchers."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.114.a.desc:0 "We just don't want to be your puppets."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.120.a.desc:0 "This is merely an excuse for your despicable actions. In the face of interests, such dignity is laughable.\n\nDo you still dare to hope that $Name_kuat$ will save you? This farce is over."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.126.a.desc:0 "Long time no see, we meet again. These impudent beings have occupied our territory for far too long, which is truly infuriating. But just now I've cleaned things up a bit, feels much better.\n\nYou seem to be in a bad state. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will soon deploy the Star Destroyer Base to annihilate you. You're quite lucky—$Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ is very interested in you. Oh no, interested in 'you' specifically. So, if you're willing to pay a price, we can stop all of this. Such a favorable deal doesn't come often."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.130.a.desc:0 "We accept the deal."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.131.a.desc:0 "Delicious indeed. We have already distorted this galaxy, and now the base of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will no longer be able to lock onto this location. Hidden within this star region lies another base of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$. Destroy it, and perhaps you still have a sliver of hope for survival."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.132.a.desc:0 "Not bad, just like you. You found [ag_kae_e_area_system.GetName] so quickly. This was once a glorious civilization—and quite fittingly, it was your ancestors. But that was long ago. You are not truly them anymore.\n\nBut since you've come this far, if you're willing to pay the price, we can give you more chances to survive. Such a favorable deal doesn't come often."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.202.a.desc:0 "Then how should we deal with $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$?"

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.203.a.desc:0 "Excellent. Do you see the jump gate at the center of this region? The Isotope 5 here can realign it. The $Name_kuat$ you helped earlier closed all the gates leading here before they left. All you need to do is redirect the jump gates of the entire galaxy. At that time, most of the fleets of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will no longer be able to locate your position, and a weakened $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will be easy enough to handle.\n\nIf you execute this successfully, everything will end. I must say, 'you' are truly fascinating."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.204.a.desc:0 "‘You’ are truly unbelievable—such high execution efficiency, unheard of!\n\nHowever, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ is coming. Don't die now. It's been a long time since anything this interesting has happened."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.205.a.desc:0 "We won't die."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.206.a.desc:0 "The imperial research department intercepted a strange signal frequency. This signal has irregular frequency characteristics to a certain degree, completely different from what we've encountered before. Through in-depth research, our scientists discovered that this frequency originates from a galaxy we've never discovered on our star maps.\n\nAs expected by $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$, we have located the garrison galaxy of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$. Defense officials claim that if we do not strike first, we will be placed at a disadvantage in retaliation from $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ in the near future."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.207.a.desc:0 "§H[Root.GetName]§! entered a strange region after passing through the hyperspace corridor. The entire §H[From.GetName]§! not only lacks normal stars but is also littered with wreckage of various ships.\n\nAt the center of §H[From.GetName]§!, §H[Root.GetName]§! detected an artificial gravity well with a radiation radius exceeding 600AU. It should originate from the damaged massive jump gate structure located at the center of the star system. Surrounding the jump gate structure, there are numerous peculiar damaged rings orbiting the central colossal structure. These rings are completely destroyed, and after scanning, none appear to be usable. Meanwhile, our reconnaissance personnel discovered that the concentrated fleets of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ in this galaxy seem to have not yet received information from $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, and they have not launched an attack on us yet. This is our perfect opportunity to strike first."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.212.a.desc:0 "Our research department discovered a new jump gate through astronomical observation. We should quickly organize a fleet to investigate the area. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will likely establish a base there to launch an attack on us."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.212.b:0 "Damn it, how did you primitives get these fleets? Don't think that just because you have the support of those merchants, you can defeat us. On the day the jump gate reactivates, your region, your empire, and your civilization will all be completely erased by us."

 ag_kae_oc_invasion_secondary_portal_poi:0 "After our researchers successfully entered this elusive central tower, they discovered that the internal structure had been severely damaged over time, including some of the tower's sophisticated defense instruments and robots, which can no longer function properly. This greatly aided our research team's investigation.\n\nOur researchers quickly located the central database facility of the ruins. Through various methods, they successfully decrypted the facility and found some astonishing data.\n\nAfter decrypting the database, our researchers successfully found the key to resealing the jump gate. By using the remaining Isotope 5, we can realign the jump gate address and thereby limit the naval tonnage passing through the gate. This will minimize the number of fleets from $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ that can arrive."
 ag_kae_oc_invasion_secondary_portal_poi_desc:0 "The jump gate located in [ag_kae_e_area_system.GetName] has completed realignment. Now, the main forces of $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will no longer be able to pass through the jump gate to reach our galaxy. They will be unable to deploy large fleets into our region.\n\nAt that time, the initiative in this war will be entirely in our hands. Fighting on home ground, the advantage is ours."

 ag_kae_ge_invasion.213.b:0 "Our researchers have successfully completed the repair of the jump gate. According to our search using the Isotope 5 signal receiver, the activation of the jump gate quickly drew attention from the other side.\n\nThis means our plan's first step has succeeded. Now it's time to wait for the prey to walk right in."

Do you really think that with the secret support of $Name_kuat$, you can defeat us?\n\nYou are nothing but our puppets. To dare to rebel means your death will be your only fate.\n\nI must say, $Name_kuat$ actually helped you shut down the other jump gates, but what good will that do? They will suffer the harshest punishment, and as for you, your only fate is destruction."
