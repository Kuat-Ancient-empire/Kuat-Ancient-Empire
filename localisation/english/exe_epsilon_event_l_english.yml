Their creator, the Infinite Empire, has long since perished. Recent data shows that our former emperor took control of the throne and brought the Eternal Fleet to the empire. Due to the gap between the Eternal Fleet's automatic system and its relatively backward weapons, the Imperial military attaches great importance to the Eternal Fleet. In the subsequent technical upgrade and transformation of the Eternal Fleet, the military combined the Empire's powerful technology and put the Eternal Fleet into combat against the rebels at the time. \n\nIt is obvious that the battle against local warlords and rebels has achieved remarkable results, successfully defeating and destroying the main fleet of the rebels. Unfortunately, if the owner of the throne loses control of the Eternal Fleet, the Eternal Fleet will restore the original extinction system and destroy everything. In fact, due to the mistakes of the emperor and the military, the emperor was buried. As for our emperor, some people say that the emperor was assassinated, but according to the results of the investigation, it is actually due to the stupid decision of the military. \n\nThe loss of control of the Eternal Fleet is inevitable, and according to the database information, the existence of a large number of completely out-of-control fleets will pose a threat to the Empire.

In addition, according to the signals we analyzed, this furnace is very similar to the communication signals of our former war machine eternal fleet. These signals gather and produce a strange magnetic field resonance here.
