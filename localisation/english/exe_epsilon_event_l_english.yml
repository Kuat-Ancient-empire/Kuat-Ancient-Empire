Although the Star Ring was damaged to a certain extent, it was still possible to land. The team landed after confirming the safe area and began to study the Star Ring. The damage to the Star Ring was not serious. The high-rise buildings and buildings in the city were clearly visible, and the entire city showed a concentric circle distribution pattern. The energy reaction inside the Star Ring was very strong, especially in the central square of the city, where the signal reaction was particularly obvious. [leader.GetName] decided to go to the area for an in-depth investigation. \n\nThe team inferred that the city was once a commercial center with a complex transportation network. The signal source in the central square seemed to be underground, and the team applied for the use of engineering machinery for excavation. A collapse occurred during the excavation, but fortunately, they found an underground railway passage, which is likely to be the source of the signal. Traveling north along the passage, the instrument's values ​​gradually increased, and they found a closed underground site with facilities that were well preserved. After the spherical facility in the control center was activated, an old image of the city was projected, showing that the Endodia Empire had organized an evacuation operation, but ultimately failed. \n\nThe research team also discovered that the Endodia Empire had tried to create a planetary defense shield, but was eventually defeated. Although the shield technology was not preserved, they found the shield technology of the planet Kuat and planned to study its feasibility. The team suggested establishing a colony on the star ring and increasing the number of scientific researchers for further research. \n\nIn addition, the team also found clues to a new star field - $Name_D_1$, which may bring new directions for the empire's exploration and expansion. \n\n$ag_legacy_stroy_recording_11_desc$" #NT!

The propeller of this ship is very advanced, much faster than ours, and equipped with a stealth generator. \n\nIts appearance and energy characteristics seem to be similar to some ships that the Endodia Empire has fought before. Perhaps what Kuat asked us to study is unusual..." #NT!

 kuat_event_memory.3.i.response: "Our researchers have successfully recorded the relevant information: According to the data given to us by $Name_kuat$ and some information we have discovered... This may be a fleet command artificial intelligence designed and built by a superpower called the Infinite Empire to save its civilization when it encountered a certain plague. It is said that it built this AI at the cost of the life force of several races and several planets. \n\nAt the same time, according to archaeological records, the Infinite Empire seems to have been destroyed because of the rebellion of them and their automated combat fleets. The truth seems chilling... Could it be that they are studying those strange fleets that the Endodia Empire once fought against..." #NT!

 kuat_event_memory.3.j.response: "Our researchers have successfully found relevant records: this huge war fortress is somehow very similar to the war fortresses we built and some of Kuat's facilities, but the various subsystems and weapons it carries seem to be more powerful. \n\nThe battle records between the Endodia Empire and the unmanned fleets from the extragalactic system. These fortresses seem to have appeared on the battlefield to provide support for those automated fleets. According to our research on interstellar communication beacons, these fortresses will be responsible for providing a steady stream of fleet support when those fleets invade, unless three special facilities are closed. So, what exactly is Kuat asking us to study..." #NT!

 kuat_event_memory.3.k.response: "Our researchers have successfully found relevant records: $Name_kuat$ told us that some of their new designs require more energy. Out of trust and apparent friendliness, they chose to give us this energy control component for research. Combined with the previous series of clues, we can probably guess what $Name_kuat$ is researching, but now may not be the time to tear faces with them. \n\nThis device is designed to optimize the output of the reactor and save the energy consumption of the ship. It seems that they are researching this type of equipment in order to use something that consumes a lot of energy?" #NT!

 kuat_event_memory.3.l.response: "Our researchers have successfully recorded the following: Similar to $Name_kuat$'s Star Dreadnought, this ship is used as a fleet flagship and has some anti-interference capabilities. However, unlike Kuat's Super Star Destroyer design, this ship is equipped with four previously studied super lasers, which seem to be used for long-range artillery fire. \n\nIn addition, the appearance of this type of ship is also mentioned in Endodia's combat log, and it seems that it is forming a combat fleet together with the battlecruisers in the automatic fleet. It seems that it is self-evident what $Name_kuat$ wants us to help research..." #NT!
