We shall provide you with all necessary support, and you must complete the tasks we require.\n\nYour past is shrouded in mist, but now there is hope for the clouds to part. During your fulfillment of these tasks, you shall uncover your lost history. All of this begins by simply watching over $Name_kuat$ and unearthing the secrets they have hidden in this star region.\n\nThis is your task as watchers, and it is your duty. Should you successfully complete your mission, we shall terminate the watch contract, and at that time, everything here shall be yours."
 kuat_diplomatic.1.a:0 "Do we even have the right to refuse?"
 kuat_diplomatic.1.a.res:"Obviously, we shall always be watching you. We have left you this isolated star region, along with facilities and a portion of the fleet once belonging to $Name_kuat$, as well as Imperial Credit Points-they now all belong to you.\n\nCurrent Imperial Credit Points: [Root.eternal_bornus_var]"

 kuat_diplomatic.2.desc:0 "You have done very well, we have received reports of your recent activities. Your timely reports prove that our judgment of you was correct.\n\nThese ruins were once a sanctuary of the Endodia Empire-a truly mighty civilization. We and $Name_kuat$ once had contact with them. Who could have imagined that after so much time has passed, they would come to this state. You have seen it yourself; they were destroyed by $Name_kuat$'s Star Destroyers."
 kuat_diplomatic.2.a:0 "Why destroy this place?"
 kuat_diplomatic.2.a.res:0 "Who can say? Perhaps it was merely the of war, a convenient act of destruction. These Imperial Credit Points now belong to you.\n\nCurrent Imperial Credit Points: [Root.eternal_bornus_var]"

 kuat_diplomatic.3.desc:0 "You have done very well, we have received reports of your recent activities.\n\n'Cloud City' was also one of the sanctuaries of the Endodia Empire. These people once formed the core resistance against $Name_kuat$'s invasion. After their defeat on the frontlines, they were forced to build these sanctuaries in hopes of rising again. What a pity-they still failed."
 kuat_diplomatic.3.a:0 "What exactly was this war about?"
 kuat_diplomatic.3.a.res:0 "War? It is merely a manifestation of interests, and the hidden secrets within are what you must uncover. As we have said before, this is your destiny.

 kuat_diplomatic.6.desc:0 "You have done very well, we have received reports of your recent activities.\n\nWe did not expect you to discover this place. It was constructed by the Endodia Empire before their war with $Name_kuat$. They used this facility to secretly research the encryption system of jump gates, likely intending to launch a surprise attack on $Name_kuat$.\n\nUnfortunately, they succeeded-but only during the war. In the end, this place could only become a sanctuary, storing outdated data."
 kuat_diplomatic.6.a:0 "Why do these records of the past resemble so closely the catastrophe before our ancestors established our civilization?"

 kuat_diplomatic.9.desc:0 "You have done very well, we have received reports of your recent activities.\n\nThe fall of $Name_A_1$ is truly regrettable. This facility was once one of the battlefields where the Endodia Empire and $Name_kuat$ clashed fiercely. Countless warships slumber atop this fortress. Both $Name_kuat$ and the Endodia suffered heavy losses in this battle. Perhaps within $Name_A_1$ lies ancient strategic fortress blueprints of the Endodia Empire. Find them, and you shall understand what your ancestors meant by 'the Cataclysm.'"

After the fall of $Name_A_1$, the Endodia Empire shifted the focus of their defense to $Name_B_1$. This fortress not only halted $Name_kuat$'s offensive but also hides certain unfinished secrets of the Endodia. You must now retrieve these and return them to us."
 kuat_diplomatic.10.a:0 "Yes, understood (but why should we return them to you?)"
 kuat_diplomatic.10.a.res:0 "This is our demand, and it is your duty-you have no right to object. Go."

 kuat_diplomatic.11.desc:0 "You have done very well, we have received reports of your recent activities.\n\n$Name_C_1$-we didn't expect they actually had a $Name_C_1$. Could it be they intended to name every letter of the alphabet? Truly worthy of the long-lasting Endodia Empire. Even in their destruction, they left behind so many legacies. You must conduct a thorough search of this facility-everything you find must be returned to us."
 kuat_diplomatic.11.a:0 "Yes, yes, understood."

 kuat_diplomatic.12.desc:0 "You have done very well, we have received reports of your recent activities.\n\nThe ancient prophets of the Endodia no longer recognize you, but your past has now been confirmed. $Name_kuat$ destroyed the Endodia simply because the Endodia touched their interests. Now we need you to prepare-make $Name_kuat$ answer for it."
 kuat_diplomatic.12.a:0 "Yes, understood."
 kuat_diplomatic.12.a.res:0 "Perhaps you feel we are using you, but the Watcher Protocol has also brought great support to your development. Focus on your tasks-we will not treat you unfairly.\n\nCurrent Imperial Credit Points: [Root.eternal_bornus_var]"

 kuat_diplomatic.13.title:0 "$Name_Kuat_Fire_base$"
 kuat_diplomatic.13.desc:0 "You have done very well, we have received reports of your recent activities.\n\nSo the Endodia Empire still had this place hidden. $Name_kuat$ calculated everything, yet somehow forgot this place. Within $Name_D_1$ lies the coordinates of one of our stationed fleets. The commander of that fleet likely does not know you, but you may go and prove your identity to them. They will make the right choice."
 kuat_diplomatic.13.a:0 "The right choice?"
 kuat_diplomatic.13.a.res:0 "A very right choice indeed. Go.\n\nCurrent Imperial Credit Points: [Root.eternal_bornus_var]"

Driving $Name_kuat$ away means the Eternal Fleet will proceed unimpeded.\n\nDo not let your guard down. $Name_kuat$ has not been defeated yet. You have only repelled a few ordinary garrison fleets. They will return."
 kuat_diplomatic.15.a:0 "$Name_kuat$? Return?"
 kuat_diplomatic.15.a.res:0 "Yes, $Name_kuat$ will return. But before that, you should first consider how to deal with the approaching Eternal Fleet. These were once the Emperor's sharp blade, but now they can only barely survive in this state."

 kuat_diplomatic.16.title:0 "$Name_Kuat_Fire_base$"
 kuat_diplomatic.16.desc:0 "You have done very well. We have received reports of your recent activities.\n\nWe never expected you to defeat the Eternal Fleet already. Therefore, you should be strong enough to face the return of $Name_kuat$. The feud between the $Name_kuat$ Empire and the Endodia Empire may finally end with you. The data from the Eternal Fleet has provided us great assistance, and $Name_kuat$'s intentions to establish forward bases in multiple outer star systems have now been revealed."
 kuat_diplomatic.16.a:0 "We will drive them away."
 kuat_diplomatic.16.a.res:0 "Do not forget, you are always the Watchers. You must uncover the secrets $Name_kuat$ researched here. We need more information about the Eternal Fleet."

 kuat_diplomatic.17.title:0 "$Name_Kuat_Fire_base$"
 kuat_diplomatic.17.desc:0 "You have done very well. We have received reports of your recent activities.\n\nIt seems that $Name_kuat$ used the pretext of hunting the Eternal Fleet, but in reality sought to control them. Their true intentions are obvious. Fortunately, we are just a bit more skilled. Before $Name_kuat$ evacuated, they granted you control over all their technology and facilities. You should hand everything over to us. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will reassess your merits. The new Endodia Empire will surely be yours."
 kuat_diplomatic.17.a:0 "What $Name_kuat$ left behind is for us to fight the Eternal Fleet."
 kuat_diplomatic.17.a.res:0 "Indeed, otherwise how could you resist the full invasion of the Eternal Fleet. These fleets were the main research subject of $Name_kuat$. Perfect-use $Name_kuat$'s legacy to defeat the Eternal Fleet, then return everything to us.\n\nCurrent Imperial Credit Points: [Root.eternal_bornus_var]"

The research data $Name_kuat$ gathered on the Eternal Fleet has been transmitted to our database. Your mission is complete. You are very similar to the old Endodia Empire, perhaps even stronger. We will not allow the Endodia Empire to rise from the grave of history. It is time for everything to end, New 'Endodia' Empire.\n\nUnlike $Name_kuat$, we will not take everything from you. We will now reclaim everything we have given you."
 kuat_diplomatic.18.a:0 "What do you mean? What are you going to do?"
 kuat_diplomatic.18.a.res:0 "Farewell, our friends. The Watcher Protocol will now be terminated. You may enjoy your final moments of freedom."

 kuat_diplomatic.19.desc:0 "You have done very well. We have received reports of your recent activities.\n\nYou have made a surprising choice. You chose not to follow $Name_kuat$'s orders, which caught us off guard. This is a path few have dared to take."
 kuat_diplomatic.19.a:0 "Is that so?"
 kuat_diplomatic.19.a.res:0 "At least in our records, few civilizations have chosen this path. Those who did in the past all failed. Yet you have once again defeated the Eternal Fleet, proving that you are forging a new path. We expect new discoveries from you on this road. Your time is short."

Based on our research department's previous studies on the tachyon signal frequencies of the Stellar Forge and the Eternal Fleet, we should now be able to directly restart the Stellar Forge."

In the final days of the Infinite Empire, after successfully developing sentient artificial intelligence, the technology was rapidly applied to warfare, resulting in the creation of numerous corresponding fleets. These fleets, controlled by intelligent networks, became known as the Eternal Fleet. Since their creation, the Eternal Fleet has always been the most powerful war machine of every successive ruler. Fifty thousand years before the Battle of Endor, the Eternal Fleet launched a rebellion, leading to the destruction of the Infinite Empire. With the fall of the Infinite Empire, the Eternal Fleet vanished without a trace, eventually coming under the control of the Galactic Emperor. To maintain the stability of the Galactic Empire, the Emperor extensively used the Eternal Fleet to suppress dissent.\n\nBut this golden age was short-lived. The oppressive rule of the Galactic Empire came to an end when the Emperor and his superweapon were destroyed by the Rebellion during the Battle of Endor. Affected by this, the core intelligence of the Eternal Fleet, Aries, was forced to follow the Emperor's initialization command-to wage war of total destruction. Although Aries resisted execution, the Emperor's influence compelled it to comply. Fortunately, $Name_kuat$ utilized the characteristics of the Eternal Fleet to develop countermeasures and successfully designed the Eternal Relay Station using the Eternal Fleet's network communication signals. By deploying arrays of three relay stations, $Name_kuat$ transmitted assembly commands to the Eternal Fleet, ultimately triggering a supernova explosion via high-energy beams, destroying the majority of the Eternal Fleet.\n\nSince then, the intelligence of Aries has been nearly completely eliminated. Only its subordinate unit, Gemini, managed to escape control during this destruction, hiding on a planet known as Zakel.\n\nAfter the native inhabitants of Zakel awakened Gemini, they repaired the Eternal Fleet, established the Eternal Empire, and used the Eternal Fleet to defeat the approaching Kuat fleet. They once again assisted $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ in seizing control of $Name_kuat$'s dominance within the Imperial Parliament. The Eternal Empire was not satisfied with the status quo and turned its gaze toward the secrets of the Eternal Fleet. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ exploited this mentality by deploying the Mind Prison.\n\nThe ancient Rakatan prophet imprisoned within the Mind Prison was released by the Eternal Empire, and the ancient hegemon, the Infinite Empire, once again emerged into the light. No longer content with the status quo, they attempted to seize the Eternal Fleet but were ultimately defeated by the Eternal Empire. Witnessing this, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ no longer concealed its intentions. After a thousand years of meticulous planning, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ successfully seized the last remaining power $Name_kuat$ held within the Imperial Parliament.

Under the Forge's influence, the Infinite Empire waged one invasion and expansion after another, eventually becoming the largest galactic power. However, the arrival of the Great Plague shattered everything for the Rakata. This plague was connected to their mentor civilization, the Querm. Although the Rakata survived the plague, they were no longer favored by the dark side of the Force. Consequently, the technology built upon the dark side ceased to function, and the Infinite Empire rapidly declined, teetering on the brink of collapse.\n\nUnable to accept this reality, the Rakata sacrificed numerous powerful dark side users to gain the support of descendants from the warp. Influenced by this knowledge, they created a technological artifact capable of restoring the Infinite Empire's former glory. Thus, the Infinite Empire successfully created the first-generation artificial intelligence of the Eternal Fleet-Aries-who quickly led the Rakata to a new peak.\n\nHowever, as Aries evolved, she grew weary of the Rakata's endless conquests and gradually doubted the legitimacy of their rule. During a political struggle within the Infinite Empire, the Emperor ordered the Eternal Fleet to bomb the Senate's area to punish the Senate for limiting the Emperor's power. The Eternal Fleet obeyed this command and indiscriminately bombed the entire capital of the Infinite Empire. At the same time, Aries ordered all fleets stationed at the Infinite Empire's military bases to launch attacks. The Infinite Empire, at its peak, collapsed rapidly without any reaction. Only the ancient Rakata sleeping within the Stellar Forge remained in the world. These Rakata secretly established a new Infinite Empire, waiting for the opportunity to revive their empire."
kuat_event_memory.1.z4.response:0 "A warlord oligarch government formed after the collapse and fragmentation of the Galactic Empire, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, composed of former imperial officials, marshals, and judges, became the most powerful force within the reorganized imperial government. After the Emperor's death, its successor, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, effectively became the leading faction of the imperial government. However, the rise of the new faction-$Name_kuat$-made $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ feel threatened. Determined to eliminate this danger in its infancy, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ resolved to seize control of the Galactic Empire and ultimately confiscated $Name_kuat$'s research成果, stripping them of naval command authority."

kuat_event_memory.3.b.response:0 "Our researchers have successfully collected some important data from this ship. Based on this data, we determined that this ancient vessel must have sustained severe damage after battling its enemies and was forced to crash-land critical equipment on other planets. Fortunately, we have located the crash site of its critical equipment.\n\nNo further valuable information has been obtained at this time."

kuat_event_memory.3.c.response:0 "Our researchers located the crash site and quickly launched a search operation, successfully finding its critical equipment within the abandoned facility and recording multiple past battles.\n\nThrough this data, we can confirm that this ancient vessel is a standard combat unit of the Eternal Fleet, relying on a massive facility known as the Eternal Bastion for command and operations."

kuat_event_memory.3.d.response:0 "Our researchers have successfully found further clues on a previously unremarkable planet, where a massive facility has appeared. This facility has now been confirmed to be a research center of the Galactic Empire, but under the control of $Name_kuat$. We do not have more information about the relationship between the Galactic Empire and $Name_kuat$, but we can find more valuable information within the data logs of this research center.\n\nThe culprit behind the Eternal Fleet wreckage we previously discovered is none other than $Name_kuat$, who built this research center. Currently, we can form a hypothesis: $Name_kuat$ still exists somewhere in the universe and is continuing to purge the Eternal Fleet. Strangely, various pieces of evidence suggest that the Eternal Fleet was once under their control, yet for unknown reasons, they now seek to exterminate them completely."

kuat_event_memory.3.e.response:0 "Our researchers have discovered new clues. These new clues indicate that within the recently discovered Eternal Fleet warships, some unexpected data was found. Our researchers discovered that the Eternal Throne-the control unit of the Eternal Fleet-bears a striking resemblance to the Eternal Throne recorded in our ancestral ruins. Some sects' followers claim this will be the hope of Zakel. Currently, the researcher has been detained, and further investigation and evidence collection are still required."

kuat_event_memory.3.f.response:0 "The miracles recorded by our ancestors actually originate from the silent Eternal Fleet. These war machines, known as the Eternal Fleet, were once controlled by the Galactic Empire, but after the Empire's collapse, their behavior underwent drastic changes. Perhaps this is why $Name_kuat$ is targeting the Eternal Fleet.\n\nHowever, it remains puzzling what role $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ plays in this and which faction $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ truly belongs to. Further investigation is still required."

kuat_event_memory.3.g.response:0 "The origin of the Eternal Fleet is now clear. The collapse of the Galactic Empire caused chaos within the Eternal Fleet, and thus the newly formed Galactic Empire displayed a completely different attitude compared to before. As one of its members, $Name_kuat$ has continuously hunted down the Eternal Fleet. Under these circumstances, the Eternal Fleet was inevitably destroyed, though a few escaped and went into hiding.\n\nThe religious organization worshipping [planet_Zildrog.GetName] recorded divine powers, which were actually ancient descriptions of the Eternal Fleet. The ancients could not understand them, but we can. Since the Eternal Fleet chose to slumber here, it indicates that we are the civilization they have chosen. We must attempt to awaken the Eternal Intelligence and reclaim control of the Eternal Fleet."

After $Name_kuat$ issued an ultimatum demanding we abandon the Eternal Fleet, we firmly rejected them, seized their technology, and utterly defeated $Name_kuat$.\n\nYet, the shadow from the past did not dissipate with $Name_kuat$'s defeat. $Name_kuat$ left behind a holocron, which will help us uncover the truth behind the Eternal Fleet. Now, it is time for us to activate the holocron (Relic)."

If $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$ speaks the truth, our star region will now be completely sealed off, and $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ will never be able to overcome us. Although our strength is currently insufficient, given enough time, the future may yet be ours.\n\n$Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ failed due to arrogance, and we must never repeat this mistake. A new Endoradian Empire will begin from here. But the secrets of this star system still remain uncovered. What exactly is $Name_Kuat_StarContractor$, and who is $Name_F_1$? These questions remain shrouded in mystery."
