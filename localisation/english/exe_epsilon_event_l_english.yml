Based on the information currently obtained, our research team believes that the explorers who previously operated on §H[kuat_ancient_epsilon_star.GetName]§! were dedicated to studying a peculiar database they referred to as the 'stellar Forge'—that massive and insane space station located at the center of §H[kuat_ancient_epsilon_star.GetName]§!.\n\nOur research team reports that the previous explorers believed this space station to be a powerful automated weapon. However, it appears that the station had already ceased operations by the time they discovered §H[kuat_ancient_epsilon_star.GetName]§!. These explorers, enticed by the fortress in the dark, decided to reactivate the entire facility's systems using tachyon signal resonance from the surrounding area. To reactivate the entire facility, the previous researchers transported three ancient obelisk-like structures from elsewhere.

To compete for influence within the Imperial Parliament, $Name_kuat$ launched an operation under the guise of eliminating the Eternal Fleet, actually attempting to reverse-engineer ancient Eternal Fleet technology.

In the late period of the Infinite Empire, after successfully developing sentient artificial intelligence, the technology was rapidly applied to warfare, resulting in the creation of large-scale fleets controlled by intelligent networks, known as the Eternal Fleet. Since their creation, the Eternal Fleet has always been the most powerful war machine of every successive controller. 50,000 years before the Battle of Endor, the Eternal Fleet launched a rebellion, leading to the destruction of the Infinite Empire. With the fall of the Infinite Empire, the Eternal Fleet vanished without a trace, eventually coming under the control of the Galactic Emperor. To maintain the stability of the Galactic Empire, the Emperor extensively used the Eternal Fleet to suppress dissent.\n\nBut good times did not last long. The oppressive rule of the Galactic Empire came to an end when the Emperor and his superweapon were destroyed by the Rebellion during the Battle of Endor. Affected by this, the core of the Eternal Fleet, the Aries Intelligence, was forced to follow the Emperor's initialization command—to launch a war of total destruction. Although Aries resisted execution, the Emperor's influence compelled it to comply. Fortunately, $Name_kuat$ utilized the characteristics of the Eternal Fleet to develop countermeasures, successfully designing the Eternal Relay Station using the Eternal Fleet's network communication signals. By deploying arrays of three relays, they sent gathering commands to the Eternal Fleet, ultimately triggering a supernova explosion via high-energy beams, destroying most of the Eternal Fleet.\n\nSince then, the Aries Intelligence has been nearly completely eliminated. Only the Gemini Intelligence, as a subordinate unit, escaped control during this destruction, hiding on a world called Zakel.\n\nAfter the native inhabitants of Zakel awakened Gemini, for their own benefit, they repaired the Eternal Fleet, established the Eternal Empire, and used the Eternal Fleet to defeat the approaching Kuat fleet, once again helping $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ seize control of $Name_kuat$'s dominance within the Imperial Parliament. The Eternal Empire was not satisfied with the status quo and turned its attention to the secrets of the Eternal Fleet. $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ psychologically projected the Mind Prison.\n\nThe Rakatan seer imprisoned within the Mind Prison was released by the Eternal Empire.

Under the Star Forge's influence, the Infinite Empire waged one invasion and expansion after another, eventually becoming the largest galactic power. However, the arrival of the Great Plague shattered everything for the Rakata. This plague was related to their enlightening civilization, the Querm. Although the Rakata survived the plague, they were no longer favored by the dark side of the Force. Consequently, the technology built upon the dark side ceased to function, and the Infinite Empire of the Rakata rapidly declined, teetering on the brink of collapse.\n\nUnable to accept this reality, the Rakata sacrificed numerous powerful dark side users to gain the support of descendants from the Unterraum. Influenced by this knowledge, they created a technological construct capable of restoring the Infinite Empire's former glory. Thus, the Infinite Empire successfully created the first-generation artificial intelligence of the Eternal Fleet—the Aries Intelligence. Aries quickly led the Rakata to a new peak.\n\nHowever, as Aries evolved, she grew weary of the Rakata's endless conquests and gradually doubted the legitimacy of Rakatan rule. During a political struggle within the Infinite Empire, the Emperor ordered the Eternal Fleet to bomb the Senate's area to punish the Senate for limiting the Emperor's power. The Eternal Fleet accepted this command and simultaneously launched indiscriminate bombing against the capital of the Infinite Empire. At the same time, Aries ordered all fleets stationed at the Infinite Empire's garrison bases to attack. In an instant, everything the once-mighty Infinite Empire had built collapsed without any reaction. Only the ancient Rakata sleeping within the Star Forge remained in the world.

After the Emperor's death, its successor, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$, effectively became the leading faction of the imperial government. However, the rise of the new faction—$Name_kuat$—made $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ feel threatened. Determined to eliminate the danger in its infancy, $Name_Kuat_Fire_base$ resolved that the Galactic Empire could only be led by itself, ultimately seizing $Name_kuat$'s research成果 and stripping $Name_kuat$ of its naval command authority."

Under these circumstances, the Eternal Fleet was inevitably destroyed, though some escaped and went into hiding.\n\nThe church organization that worships [planet_Zildrog.GetName] records the divine power of celestial gods, which is actually an ancient description of the Eternal Fleet.

These beams then pass through an intricately designed focusing device and particle acceleration track, resulting in significantly greater destructive power.
