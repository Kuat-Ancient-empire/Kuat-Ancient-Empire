Our scientific research team hopes that the colonial government of §H[Root.GetName]§! can allocate resources to support our scientific research team's strange database for research and investigation, and add some tachyon signal amplifiers in the ruins to help our scientific research team study this strange tachyon signal. \n\nUnfortunately, the work of transforming the strange database on §H[Root.GetName]§! is not easy.

Under the guidance of the dark force, these explorers show their ambitions and desires, trying to master the entire facility and even try to rule the entire universe. \n\nThey explored the ancient galaxies that do not exist on the coordinates. Unfortunately, they were guided by the tachyon signal emitted by the furnace and came here, becoming fertilizer for the furnace. Since the collapse of the Rakata Empire, the automatic operation maintenance system of the entire star furnace has gradually become independent. Due to the long-term use of the dark force by the Rakata Infinite Empire, the entire fortress has almost become a semi-living body. It is using the dark force to drive and manipulate everyone who tries to control it. This is a fortress full of expansion and war desires, which step by step devours the principles and ideas of its users. \n\nWhile our scientists continue to investigate, some of the data in this facility has been almost destroyed, and we cannot obtain some valuable information from here."

Under the temptation of the star furnace, they gradually walked into the abyss of corrosion. When the explorers explored the ruins, they found that these strange database facilities were very similar to the facilities they had in another galaxy where the intergalactic weapon guardian was located. \n\nBut the explorers did not have the opportunity to further investigate this part. They started from the part that could be known in the ruins and analyzed the magnetic field resonance and tachyon signal frequency in the ruins. They found that these tachyon signal frequencies seemed to be the resonant frequencies of some intelligent systems. Although these resonant frequencies can be detected by instruments, they are extremely stable and cannot be interfered with. When the explorers found that they could not interfere with the tachyon signals, they decided to put these signals into the entire star furnace through the diagonally corresponding facilities to let it run. \n\nHowever, just as we were looking for more information, our clues were interrupted, and now we should go to the next facility to search."

This battle was unpredictable for everyone at that time. After reacting, more explorers joined the battle to survive and gain strength. \n\nWhat is surprising is that the explorers tried their best just to kill each other and fight for this star furnace, but none of them won, and the last survivors died in this fortress. In addition, according to the signals we analyzed, this furnace is very similar to the communication signals of our former war machine eternal fleet. These signals gather and produce a strange magnetic field resonance here. Although we cannot know the specific information of this furnace, its history is full of fear and war, and our researchers believe that its creator has basically been completely destroyed.\n\nOur scientific research team and the parliament believe that we can use the star furnace to provide strong support for our fleet operations.
