The magnetic field and gravity of the planet form a resonance mode that is different from other planets. The resonance of this mode causes a special tachyon signal.

The atmosphere and storm of this gaseous planet were not like ordinary gas. The storms of the planets are generally distributed. The storms of this planet have been surrounding the huge floating building in the center. The whole building is standing still under the surrounding of the storm. This should be the place we are looking for. \n[leader.GetName] decided to lead her team to the floating building in the middle of the storm. [leader.GetName] found that this floating building is very huge after a general investigation of the floating building. There are a large number of well-preserved construction facilities built in the huge building. These facilities seem to be specially built to avoid any enemy.

This central tower is not only the core building of Cloud City, but also seems to be related to the abnormal storm on this planet. The entire central tower is the Control system of the entire refuge. Although there are no signs of life here, the ancient facilities in the tower are still in operation. These facilities allow these storms to continue to wreak havoc on the planet. [leader.GetName] decided to continue investigating. After going deep into the central tower facility of Cloud City, it was discovered that an ancient computing device at the top of the central tower was still operating normally.

The truth cannot be buried. \nOur empire was once very strong. Relying on the rapid growth and development of the military industry, military technology has quickly made us the most powerful force in the galaxy, but we are not satisfied with this. Our ambition has led us to a path that will never be restored, and we have accepted the so-called support from outsiders. The imperial government hoped to learn from the skills of barbarians to control barbarians, but they never thought that we were just puppets being manipulated. The Empire signed an agreement to bring us into the abyss, and we therefore purchased and introduced a large number of their advanced ship production lines and technologies.

According to the deciphering results of the remaining paper documents and working computer terminals by the language department, we have a rough grasp of the language used by the creator of this underground facility, and we also understand the meaning of the sentence on the door: §R Eighth Refuge§!. \n\nAfter deciphering the language, everything becomes easier. According to the core content of the data found in the cabin of a suspected regional management center, the builder here is an ancient civilization. Because they were involved in a huge war, and the battlefield situation was already precarious, this civilization tried to rejuvenate in the future and built ten permanent refuges. \n\nAs the lately completed one of the ten refuges, it is responsible for multiple responsibilities such as large resource storage stations, refugee shelters, and environmental transformation facilities that will implement the transformation of the Gaia planet in the future. However, according to the core administrative text, the shelter occupancy plan, which should have been advanced step by step, had to be stopped abruptly due to some extremely mysterious reason, and all subsequent relevant data have been artificially erased and absolutely absolutely. It is impossible to recover. Along with these precious data, the name of the race and country of this race and all the detailed information related to the history of their empire were erased. \n\nIf you want to know what happened in this empire, the deciphering of the central hub with extremely strict encryption measures is imperative."

    executor_build.34.desc:"Except for the central computer in the center, we have collected and analyzed all remaining paper documents, as well as all other electronic terminals that are still functioning or have minor damage. Although we have benefited a lot from it, if we want to truly unravel the mystery of the eighth refuge, we must figure out what is stored in the central computer located in the center of the facility. If we say that the process of cracking and solving other computers in the facility is full of ups and downs, the process of cracking and analyzing the central computer can be regarded as difficult as climbing, so that our scientific researchers once suspected that this was exuding. Is the faint green iron pillar completely locked? Finally, after countless days and nights of long torture, our deciphering work finally achieved a key breakthrough, and the permissions of some central data repositories were finally opened to us. \n\nHowever, when we started to look up the unlocked part of the database with full expectation, all we got were large pieces of extremely damaged data files. Among them, the humanities documents are basically all damaged, and only the parts of the science and technology documents that are equal to or slightly ahead of our current technological level have been retained. Our data analysis specialist speculates that in order to prevent their final legacy from being completely exposed to certain threats, this civilization is very likely to have designed a data destruction program to prevent a country from following in their footsteps after acquiring their knowledge. \n\nIn desperation, in order to obtain all the data that is expected to survive and the full control rights of this facility, our analysis has to continue. However, judging from the expression of the data commissioner after learning of the decision, this will never be easy."

    executor_build.35.desc:"Although our deciphering work cannot bring a qualitative leap to our existing technology, in order to thoroughly master this valuable facility and uncover all the mysteries, we still have to bite the bullet and complete this deciphering task. With the accumulation of experience, the work speed of our cracking team is gradually accelerating, and I believe that the entire solution process can also be improved accordingly. Finally, as the last data module was completely cracked, we obtained full access to this facility. As we previously expected, the massive scientific and technological documents in the database used to revive the empire were destroyed by the central computer in the anti-cracking process, and the remaining part is only higher than our current technology. And all the humanities and administrative documents related to the empire, except for individual collections that escaped a catastrophe due to omissions or other reasons, all the others were deleted, and there was no scum left. \n\nDisappointed, our researchers began to examine the remaining lucky ones. The result is not surprising: in addition to some extremely simple documents that roughly summarize the historical situation of the empire at that time, most of the others are also documents related to the operation of this shelter, such as facility manuals. \n\nHowever, we still have some discoveries after all. According to the deciphering result of a '§R<error>§! Refuge Information Summary' found in the residual documents, there is a special refuge codenamed Top secret technology related to Stargate. This information was recorded along with the specific coordinates of this facility. Fortunately, we successfully found the hyperspace channel leading to this coordinate. The preliminary star field scan has also been updated on the star map. \n\nIn addition, as we have fully mastered this facility, all the resources stored in the facility are now available to us. At the same time, the moment we unlocked the full authority of the central computer, the Gaia transformation of the entire planet began to run automatically, and the results are expected to be seen soon."

On the surface, the planet is unremarkable, covered in thick ice and snow everywhere. However, our signal signal searcher clearly found the signal frequency that was located under the planet and was exactly the same signal frequency on the previous planet.

However, unlike the previous shelter, the security level of this shelter is extremely high. Except for the automatic defense system we encountered on the way forward, the gate of this shelter is also very strong and is complicated by complicated procedures. Locked. According to our team's comprehensive analysis of the material and strength of the gate, it is absolutely impossible to blast the gate without causing serious damage with our current science and technology.

Judging from the scan results, it is not so much a refuge here, as it is a kind of data storage facility: a large number of closed servers are randomly placed in the main warehouse of the facility, and a large number of damages are scattered in various corners. The data terminal; and the cabin that should store the reserve materials is also full of all kinds of data storage equipment. Like the last shelter, there is a cylindrical central computer in operation at the center of the facility. Judging from the rough scan, the entire facility is extremely messy, with parts and documents scattered all over the place in some places.

However, just like all previous data terminals, all data related to the humanities and history of the empire were cleaned up, leaving only a few words about the war that might drag the entire galaxy into flames at that time. According to the recovered data, this data storage center named 'Different Ways' was originally built as the last refuge. As the last refuge, the empire invested an incalculable amount of manpower and material resources on it, and at the time it had successfully used advanced nanotechnology to transform it into a paradise on earth. However, after the war situation in the empire further deteriorated, according to an order from the empire’s top management, the original reserve resources and garrison personnel were withdrawn in large numbers. Instead, a large number of data storage terminals and server groups were suddenly formed in batches. Batch transfer here. After conducting 'confidential treatment' on these terminals, the last garrison evacuated the place, blocked the facility gate, and detonated a certain weather weapon before leaving, turning the place back into an ice-bound hell. \n\nSubsequently, all information related to this place was erased, leaving only the overview of this place in the Eighth Vault.

When our data staff happily accessed the local area network and began to check the overall situation, they found that most of the documents in these servers had been severely damaged. No matter how our data engineers repair the files, there will always be only one line of garbled characters in these files. Some members suspected that this was a security protection mechanism for server files, and tried to run a security unlocking program on these files, but they still failed. \n\nNow, the desperate data team is doing further processing of these files, hoping to find something useful from them."

Perhaps, this computer may hold the answers we need. However, considering the difficulty of central computer decoding, we must invest more resources and time, and we must be psychologically prepared for the worst. Our chief physicist speculates that it may take months or even years for our team to fully unlock this facility, unless our computer technology can achieve greater and more significant breakthroughs. \n\nIn addition, it is worth mentioning that after transferring and clearing the files that we cannot handle now, some idle servers and computers in the main hall can share our considerable calculations due to their outstanding computing performance. pressure.

The topics cover a wide range, from complex function questions to physics questions to wonderful laws and logic questions. Some topics even involve advanced knowledge that we are researching or have not yet studied, and the content of these topics is related to research or knowledge. The bottleneck stage is closely related. Our chief physicist stated that if we do not answer the questions and unlock the permissions by hard cracking, the facility will not be opened. In desperation, we can only temporarily write a prize-winning game, program all the topics into the game content, and call on people of insight across the country to solve the problems together without revealing the secrets. \n\nIt is said that [leader.GetName] once complained to team members during a break after solving a problem: 'It seems to be back to the painful and happy student age'."

The central computer did not stop our copying for some reason. \n\nAfter fully obtaining the permissions, we found all the descriptions related to Star Gate in a folder in the database, and how to unlock it. This so-called star gate is exactly the mysterious ring-shaped star gate we discovered during interstellar exploration. The document mentioned that this portal was built by an extremely powerful alien civilization in ancient times and was locked by an extremely complex special code. However, in a certain war, the empire in its heyday discovered a way to unlock the Stargate from a captured data facility and kept a record of it. In that battle the battlefield situation became increasingly unfavorable due to the sharp decline of the imperial power. At a critical juncture, in order to let future generations know the reason for everything, in order to allow future generations to have the opportunity to touch this dusty secret, the top of the empire will permanently store this secret in this place after all the empire they know will be destroyed. Finally, it is the most confidential refuge, and all the knowledge that can be helpful to future generations is preserved here. \n\nAt the end of the file it reads: It is destined to find strangers here.

Of course, because our system has some dangerous facilities, you cannot be allowed to enter our system, and any access to the system area has been closed. Communication on communication is also a good choice. Is there anything you need to know?"

Regarding the ancient empire database of the star field, we found that a place located on the opposite corner of the habitable star ring in the star field seems to be automatic There are similar frequency bands of ancient tachyon signals on the ring belt of the research facility, although they are very weak and hidden, our researchers still found the database key we need to find in this ring region that seems to be similar to the normal star ring Now we should probably carry out related research on this database to help our next scientific research projects and research progress. \n\nIt is worth noting that this star ring area once belonged to a scientific research center of an ancient civilization. According to our previous research on the database, [ancient_shadow_place.GetName] may be a way for us to deepen our understanding of ancient civilizations important way.

It is almost impossible for the ruins of abandoned colonies with burning traces to appear. Our researchers deduced that the star ring here should be destroyed by the civilization that bombed the star field like other star rings, but the overall According to the investigation of the entire Starlink, the facilities here are relatively well preserved, perhaps because the unknown civilization that bombed found something here, and they slowed down the bombing, or there was something unknown here that hindered it.

Just like the previous ruins, this facility is not only an automatic scientific research facility for ancient civilizations, but also a military technology test center for ancient civilizations. We should infer from some of the remaining architectural traces here that we should still be able to obtain some information about the facility. But because the ancient civilization was obviously hit by a major destructive blow, this facility was also bombed and damaged by some force like the ring we landed on before, but I don't know if it was because of the shield or some other reason. , the bomber seems to have deliberately slowed down the bombing, otherwise it is almost impossible for us to find the ruins of the abandoned colony with burning traces left by the bombing in some areas of the star ring. Our researchers From this, it can be inferred that the star ring here should be destroyed by the civilization that bombed the star field like other star rings. However, some circumstances have caused this facility and the previous discovered facility to preserve a small amount of information, but From the overall investigation of the entire Starlink, the situation here is almost the same as before.

According to most cities in the Star Ring area, these urban facilities are not as dilapidated as the previously discovered livable places. The urban buildings here are even relatively well preserved, and a large number of high-rise buildings are still preserved after the war. In this relatively urban relic, our researchers actually found that there is no life in the surface environment of the entire facility planet. By scanning the surrounding thermal signals, we can determine that the surrounding area of the city has completely lost its vitality. It is very similar to our neutron purification bombing method. The bomber should have used this inhumane bombing method to completely destroy the entire facility. Now it is completely a dead city. \n\nIt is worth noting that our tachyon sensor scans the star ring, and the tower in the center of the city emits weak and intermittent tachyon signals. Our researchers believe that this should be what we want. The location of the database key to look for."

The tall buildings that stand still have been preserved, although they have lost their life. Comparing with the previous ruins, this facility should be the same as the previous one.
